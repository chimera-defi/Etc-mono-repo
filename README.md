## Development Guidelines

- All AI-generated artifacts go in `.cursor/artifacts/`
- Keep experimental projects organized in their respective folders
- Follow platform-specific conventions
- Document setup and requirements in each project's README

## Getting Started

Each project in `mobile_experiments/` has its own README with specific setup instructions.
