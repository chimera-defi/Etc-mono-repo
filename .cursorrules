# Cursor Rules for Mobile Experiments Repository

## Project Structure
- All AI-generated artifacts and temporary files should be placed in `.cursor/artifacts/`
- Keep experimental projects organized in their respective folders (e.g., `mobile experiments/Valdi/`)
- Maintain clean separation between source code and generated content

## Code Organization
- Follow platform-specific conventions (iOS/Swift, React Native, etc.)
- Keep experimental code well-documented with clear comments
- Use consistent naming conventions within each project

## File Management
- Never litter the root directory with generated files
- Place all temporary or generated artifacts in `.cursor/artifacts/`
- Keep README files updated with project status and setup instructions

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- When generating code, prefer creating new files over modifying existing ones unless explicitly requested
- Always check for existing similar implementations before creating new ones
- Document assumptions and limitations in code comments
- When unsure about framework specifics, create a flexible structure that can be adapted

## Valdi Framework Notes
- Valdi is a new mobile app framework from Snapchat for iOS development
- Structure should be flexible to accommodate actual Valdi API once documentation is available
- Current boilerplate uses React-like syntax as a placeholder - adjust based on actual Valdi API
- Keep iOS-specific considerations in mind (Swift, Objective-C, or JavaScript bridge)

## Meta Learnings
- When working with new/experimental frameworks:
  1. Start with minimal viable structure
  2. Document assumptions clearly
  3. Create flexible boilerplates that can adapt
  4. Keep experimental code separate from production-ready code
  5. Always include setup instructions and next steps in README
  6. When documentation is unavailable, create comprehensive handoff documents:
     - Task lists with clear priorities
     - Understanding documents explaining research strategy
     - Documentation placeholders for discovered information
     - Next steps documents with actionable items
  7. For agent handoffs, create:
     - HANDOFF.md with quick start guide
     - TASKS.md with detailed task breakdown
     - UNDERSTANDING.md with context and research strategy
     - NEXT_STEPS.md with prioritized action items
  8. Document search attempts and results, even if unsuccessful
  9. Clearly mark placeholder code vs. actual framework code
  10. Set realistic expectations about framework availability

## Best Practices
- Use semantic versioning for packages
- Include proper .gitignore files for each project type
- Maintain clear separation between different experiments
- Document tooling requirements and setup steps
- Keep dependencies minimal for experimental projects
