# Liquidity Bootstrap Plan - stAZTEC Protocol

**Created:** December 30, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Purpose:** Plan for bootstrapping stAZTEC liquidity

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Establish deep liquidity for stAZTEC/AZTEC pair to make stAZTEC truly "liquid"

**Strategy:** Multi-pronged approach combining partnerships, incentives, and organic growth

**Timeline:**
- **Pre-Launch:** Secure DEX partnerships
- **Launch:** Initial liquidity seeding
- **Month 1:** Incentive program launch
- **Month 3:** Self-sustaining liquidity

---

## Liquidity Requirements

### Target Metrics

**Launch (Day 1):**
- Initial liquidity: $50k-$100k
- Depth: $10k trade <2% slippage
- Spread: <1%

**Month 1:**
- Liquidity: $500k+
- Depth: $50k trade <2% slippage
- Spread: <0.5%

**Month 3:**
- Liquidity: $2M+
- Depth: $100k trade <2% slippage
- Spread: <0.3%

### Calculation Methodology

**Slippage Formula:**
```
Slippage = (Trade Size / Liquidity Depth) × Price Impact Factor
Target: <2% slippage for $10k trade
```

**Required Liquidity:**
- $10k trade, 2% slippage → $500k liquidity minimum
- $50k trade, 2% slippage → $2.5M liquidity minimum
- $100k trade, 2% slippage → $5M liquidity minimum

---

## Liquidity Sources

### 1. Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)

**Strategy:** Protocol provides initial liquidity from protocol treasury

**Amount:** $50k-$100k initial

**Structure:**
- 50% AZTEC
- 50% stAZTEC (minted from protocol stake)

**Risks:**
- Capital requirement
- Impermanent loss exposure
- Liquidity lock-up

**Mitigation:**
- Start small, grow organically
- Monitor IL exposure
- Gradual withdrawal as organic liquidity grows

---

### 2. Liquidity Mining Incentives

**Strategy:** Incentivize LPs with rewards (points, tokens, or direct incentives)

**Program Structure:**

**Phase 1: Launch (Month 1)**
- **Budget:** $10k-$20k
- **Structure:** Points system (convertible to tokens post-TGE)
- **Duration:** 1 month
- **Target:** $500k+ liquidity

**Phase 2: Growth (Month 2-3)**
- **Budget:** $20k-$30k
- **Structure:** Token incentives (post-TGE) or continued points
- **Duration:** 2 months
- **Target:** $2M+ liquidity

**Phase 3: Sustainability (Month 4+)**
- **Budget:** $0 (organic growth)
- **Structure:** Natural liquidity from usage
- **Target:** Self-sustaining liquidity

---

### 3. Strategic Partnerships

**Strategy:** Partner with DEXs and liquidity providers

**Approach:**
- Co-marketing opportunities
- Joint liquidity programs
- Partnership incentives
- Technical integration support

**Benefits:**
- Access to DEX user base
- Co-marketing support
- Technical integration
- Long-term relationships

---

### 4. Community Liquidity

**Strategy:** Encourage community to provide liquidity

**Approach:**
- Educational content (how to LP)
- LP guides and tutorials
- Community incentives
- Recognition programs

**Benefits:**
- Decentralized liquidity
- Community ownership
- Long-term sustainability

---

## Incentive Program Design

### Option 1: Points System (Pre-TGE)

**Structure:**
- LPs earn points based on:
  - Liquidity provided (amount × time)
  - Trading volume generated
  - Long-term commitment (bonus for holding)
- Points convertible to tokens post-TGE

**Advantages:**
- No immediate capital requirement
- Flexible redemption
- Community engagement

**Disadvantages:**
- Value uncertainty (points not tradeable)
- Requires trust in future token value

---

### Option 2: Direct Incentives (Post-TGE)

**Structure:**
- LPs receive protocol tokens directly
- Based on liquidity provided and trading volume
- Distributed weekly or monthly

**Advantages:**
- Immediate value
- Transparent rewards
- Market-driven

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires token launch
- Regulatory considerations
- Capital requirement

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Structure:**
- Pre-TGE: Points system
- Post-TGE: Token incentives
- Transition: Points convert to tokens

**Advantages:**
- Best of both worlds
- Flexible timing
- Community engagement

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex
- Requires careful planning

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Thin Liquidity Risks

**Risk:** Low liquidity → High slippage → Poor user experience

**Mitigation:**
- Initial liquidity seeding ($50k-$100k)
- Liquidity mining incentives
- Multiple DEX integrations
- Gradual growth strategy

---

### Bank Run Risks

**Risk:** Large withdrawal requests → Liquidity drain → Protocol issues

**Mitigation:**
- Liquidity buffer management
- Withdrawal queue (7-day unbonding)
- Multiple liquidity sources
- Emergency procedures

---

### Impermanent Loss Risks

**Risk:** LPs face IL if stAZTEC/AZTEC price diverges

**Mitigation:**
- Educational content about IL
- IL protection mechanisms (if applicable)
- Transparent risk disclosure
- Long-term LP incentives

---

## Success Metrics
