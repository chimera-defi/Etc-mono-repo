Tweet 1: Hook
🚀 stAZTEC is LIVE on Aztec Network mainnet!

The first production-ready liquid staking protocol for Aztec is now live.

Deposit AZTEC → Receive stAZTEC → Earn 8% APY + stay liquid 🧵

Tweet 2: The Problem
Right now, staking AZTEC requires:
• 200k AZTEC minimum (~$8k)
• Tokens locked until unstaking
• No DeFi composability

This locks up $22.8M+ in staked AZTEC with no liquidity option.

Tweet 3: The Solution
stAZTEC solves this:

✅ Deposit ANY amount (no minimum)
✅ Receive liquid stAZTEC tokens instantly
✅ Use stAZTEC in DEXs, lending, and DeFi
✅ Earn 8% APY while maintaining liquidity

Tweet 4: How It Works
Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Deposit AZTEC → Receive stAZTEC (1:1 initially)
2️⃣ Protocol stakes your AZTEC to validators
3️⃣ Rewards accrue → Exchange rate increases
4️⃣ Your stAZTEC becomes worth more over time

Simple, transparent, automated.

Tweet 5: Key Features
Why stAZTEC is different:

🔒 Privacy-native (built 100% on Aztec)
🚀 First-mover advantage (no competition yet)
💰 Zero capital requirements (users provide 100%)
⚡ Instant liquidity (no lock-up period)
🛡️ Security-first (audited, insured)

Tweet 6: Use Cases
Use stAZTEC for:

💱 DeFi yield farming (stake + farm)
📊 Lending collateral (borrow against stAZTEC)
🔄 DEX liquidity (provide LP with stAZTEC)
📈 Portfolio diversification (liquid staking exposure)

Your staked AZTEC, your way.

Tweet 7: Security & Trust
Security is our top priority:

✅ 2 independent smart contract audits
✅ Bug bounty program ($50k+ pool)
✅ Insurance fund (covers slashing)
✅ Self-operated validators (reliable infrastructure)
✅ Open-source code (transparent)

We've built this right.

Tweet 8: Ecosystem Ready
stAZTEC is already integrated:

🔗 [DEX Partner] - Trade stAZTEC/AZTEC
🔗 [Lending Partner] - Use as collateral
🔗 More integrations coming soon

Built for the Aztec ecosystem, by the Aztec ecosystem.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

stAZTEC Launches First Liquid Staking Protocol on Aztec Network

[City, Date] - stAZTEC, the first production-ready liquid staking protocol for Aztec Network, today announced its mainnet launch, enabling Aztec token holders to stake their tokens while maintaining liquidity.

The protocol addresses a critical gap in the Aztec ecosystem: while $22.8M in AZTEC is currently staked, there was no liquid staking option available. stAZTEC allows users to deposit any amount of AZTEC and receive liquid stAZTEC tokens, which can be used in DeFi applications while earning staking rewards.

"Aztec Network has a thriving staking ecosystem, but users were locked out of DeFi opportunities," said [Founder Name], [Title]. "stAZTEC changes that by making staked AZTEC liquid and composable."

Key features include:
• Privacy-native architecture (built 100% on Aztec)
• No minimum deposit requirement
• Instant liquidity (no lock-up period)
• Security-first design (audited, insured, self-operated validators)

The protocol is already integrated with key Aztec DeFi protocols, including [DEX Partner] and [Lending Partner], with more integrations planned.

About stAZTEC:
stAZTEC is the first liquid staking protocol built specifically for Aztec Network, enabling users to stake AZTEC while maintaining liquidity and DeFi composability.
