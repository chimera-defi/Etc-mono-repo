**Date:** Launch Day (TBD)  
**Format:** 10-tweet thread  
**Status:** Draft

## Thread Content

### Tweet 1: Hook
```
🚀 stAZTEC is LIVE on Aztec Network mainnet!

The first production-ready liquid staking protocol for Aztec is now live.

Deposit AZTEC → Receive stAZTEC → Earn 8% APY + stay liquid 🧵
```

### Tweet 2: The Problem
```
Right now, staking AZTEC requires:
• 200k AZTEC minimum (~$8k)
• Tokens locked until unstaking
• No DeFi composability

This locks up $22.8M+ in staked AZTEC with no liquidity option.
```

### Tweet 3: The Solution
```
stAZTEC solves this:

✅ Deposit ANY amount (no minimum)
✅ Receive liquid stAZTEC tokens instantly
✅ Use stAZTEC in DEXs, lending, and DeFi
✅ Earn 8% APY while maintaining liquidity
```

### Tweet 4: How It Works
```
Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Deposit AZTEC → Receive stAZTEC (1:1 initially)
2️⃣ Protocol stakes your AZTEC to validators
3️⃣ Rewards accrue → Exchange rate increases
4️⃣ Your stAZTEC becomes worth more over time

Simple, transparent, automated.
```

### Tweet 5: Key Features
```
Why stAZTEC is different:

🔒 Privacy-native (built 100% on Aztec)
🚀 First-mover advantage (no competition yet)
💰 Zero capital requirements (users provide 100%)
⚡ Instant liquidity (no lock-up period)
🛡️ Security-first (audited, insured)
```

### Tweet 6: Use Cases
```
Use stAZTEC for:

💱 DeFi yield farming (stake + farm)
📊 Lending collateral (borrow against stAZTEC)
🔄 DEX liquidity (provide LP with stAZTEC)
📈 Portfolio diversification (liquid staking exposure)

Your staked AZTEC, your way.
```

### Tweet 7: Security & Trust
```
Security is our top priority:

✅ 2 independent smart contract audits
✅ Bug bounty program ($50k+ pool)
✅ Insurance fund (covers slashing)
✅ Self-operated validators (reliable infrastructure)
✅ Open-source code (transparent)

We've built this right.
```

### Tweet 8: Ecosystem Ready
```
stAZTEC is already integrated:

🔗 [DEX Partner] - Trade stAZTEC/AZTEC
🔗 [Lending Partner] - Use as collateral
🔗 More integrations coming soon

Built for the Aztec ecosystem, by the Aztec ecosystem.
```
