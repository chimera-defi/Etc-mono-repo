# Marketing & Business Development - stAZTEC Protocol

**Created:** December 30, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for execution  
**Target Launch:** Q2 2026

---

## Brand Positioning

**Tagline:** "Liquid staking for Aztec. Earn rewards while staying liquid."

**Key Differentiators:**
1. Privacy-native (built 100% on Aztec, not adapted)
2. First-mover (first production-ready liquid staking on Aztec)
3. Zero capital requirements (users provide 100% of staking capital)
4. Self-operated validators (vertical integration)

**Target Audience:**
- Primary: AZTEC holders who want to stake but need liquidity
- Secondary: DeFi users on Aztec, privacy-focused crypto users, Aztec ecosystem developers

## Messaging Framework

| Audience | Pain Point | Our Solution | Proof Point |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| AZTEC Holders | 200k AZTEC minimum (~$8k), tokens locked | Deposit any amount, receive liquid stAZTEC | No minimum, instant liquidity |
| DeFi Users | Staked tokens can't be used in DeFi | stAZTEC is composable, use in DEXs/lending | Liquid token, DeFi-ready |
| Privacy Users | Most LSTs are on transparent chains | Built on Aztec (privacy-native) | Privacy-first architecture |
| Yield Seekers | Current 166% APY will normalize | 8% APY steady-state, predictable | Sustainable yield model |

## Partnership Strategy

### Integration Targets

**Tier 1 (Launch Critical - P0):**
- **DEX:** stAZTEC/AZTEC liquidity pool (required for "liquid" to be real)
- **Wallets:** Token metadata and display (required for UX)

**Tier 2 (Post-Launch - P1):**
- **Lending:** stAZTEC as collateral (increases utility)
- **Additional DEXs:** More liquidity venues

**Tier 3 (Future - P2-P3):**
- Bridges, yield aggregators, other DeFi integrations

### Partnership Value Proposition

**For DEXs:**
- New trading pair (stAZTEC/AZTEC), expected high volume
- Co-marketing support, technical integration support
- **We need:** Liquidity pool creation, token listing, launch coordination

**For Lending Protocols:**
- High-quality collateral (staking rewards accrue)
- Growing TVL, co-marketing support
- **We need:** stAZTEC accepted as collateral, competitive collateral factor

**For Wallets:**
- Token metadata, integration support, user education
- **We need:** Token display support, balance queries, transfer functionality
