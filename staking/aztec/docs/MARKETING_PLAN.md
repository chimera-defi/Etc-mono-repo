**Target Launch:** Q2 2026

---

## Brand Positioning

### Tagline
**"Liquid staking for Aztec. Earn rewards while staying liquid."**

### Key Differentiators
1. **Privacy-Native:** Built 100% on Aztec (privacy-focused L2), not adapted from Ethereum
2. **First-Mover:** First production-ready liquid staking protocol on Aztec Network
3. **Zero Capital Requirements:** Users provide 100% of staking capital, no protocol capital needed
4. **Self-Operated Validators:** Vertical integration ensures reliability and control

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
- AZTEC token holders who want to stake but need liquidity
- DeFi users on Aztec Network seeking yield opportunities
- Privacy-focused crypto users interested in Aztec ecosystem

**Secondary:**
- Ethereum liquid staking users (stETH, rETH holders) exploring Aztec
- Institutional stakers looking for Aztec exposure
- Aztec ecosystem developers building on stAZTEC

## Messaging Framework

| Audience | Pain Point | Our Solution | Proof Point |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **AZTEC Holders** | 200k AZTEC minimum to stake (~$8k), tokens locked | Deposit any amount, receive liquid stAZTEC | No minimum, instant liquidity |
| **DeFi Users** | Staked tokens can't be used in DeFi | stAZTEC is composable, use in DEXs/lending | Liquid token, DeFi-ready |
| **Privacy Users** | Most LSTs are on transparent chains | Built on Aztec (privacy-native) | Privacy-first architecture |
| **Yield Seekers** | Current 166% APY will normalize, want steady returns | 8% APY steady-state, predictable | Sustainable yield model |
