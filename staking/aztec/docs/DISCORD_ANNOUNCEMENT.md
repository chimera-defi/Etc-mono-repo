# stAZTEC Mainnet Launch: Liquid Staking Comes to Aztec Network

We're thrilled to announce that stAZTEC, the first production-ready liquid staking protocol for Aztec Network, is now live on mainnet.

## What is stAZTEC?

stAZTEC is a liquid staking protocol that allows Aztec token holders to stake their AZTEC while maintaining liquidity. Users deposit AZTEC and receive stAZTEC tokens, which can be used in DeFi applications while earning staking rewards.

## Key Features

### Privacy-Native Architecture
Built 100% on Aztec Network, stAZTEC is designed from the ground up for privacy-focused staking. Unlike adapted protocols, stAZTEC leverages Aztec's unique architecture.

### First-Mover Advantage
With $22.8M already staked on Aztec and no liquid staking option available, stAZTEC is the first to market.

### Zero Capital Requirements
Users provide 100% of staking capital. No protocol capital required, making stAZTEC accessible to all.

### Instant Liquidity
Unlike traditional staking, stAZTEC tokens are liquid and can be used immediately in DeFi applications.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit:** Users deposit AZTEC (any amount, no minimum)
2. **Receive:** Users receive stAZTEC tokens (1:1 initially)
3. **Stake:** Protocol stakes AZTEC to validators
4. **Rewards:** Staking rewards accrue, increasing the exchange rate
5. **Liquid:** Users can use stAZTEC in DeFi or withdraw anytime

## Security

Security is our top priority:

- **2 Independent Audits:** Smart contracts audited by leading security firms
- **Bug Bounty:** $50k+ bug bounty program on Immunefi
- **Insurance Fund:** Protocol maintains insurance fund for slashing events
- **Self-Operated Validators:** Reliable infrastructure under our control
- **Open Source:** All code is open source and auditable

## Ecosystem Integration

stAZTEC is already integrated with key Aztec DeFi protocols:

- **[DEX Partner]:** Trade stAZTEC/AZTEC pairs
- **[Lending Partner]:** Use stAZTEC as collateral
- More integrations coming soon
