## Mandatory Review Protocol (All Agents)

**Every agent must follow this review protocol before marking any deliverable complete:**

### Multi-Step Review Checklist (Per .cursorrules #15, #24)

```
1. DEVELOPER PERSPECTIVE: Can another developer use this?
   - [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
   - [ ] Dependencies documented
   - [ ] Setup instructions work from scratch

2. REVIEWER PERSPECTIVE: Is this correct?
   - [ ] Logic matches specification
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] No dead code or unused imports

3. USER PERSPECTIVE: Does it actually work?
   - [ ] Happy path tested
   - [ ] Error states handled gracefully
   - [ ] Clear error messages

4. MAINTAINER PERSPECTIVE: Can this be maintained?
   - [ ] Code is readable and commented
   - [ ] No hardcoded values (use config)
   - [ ] Tests exist for core functionality

5. PM PERSPECTIVE: What could go wrong?
   - [ ] Risks documented
   - [ ] Blockers flagged
   - [ ] Assumptions stated explicitly
```

### Verification Commands (Per .cursorrules #24, #61)

Before marking ANY deliverable complete, run ALL applicable:
```bash
# For Noir contracts
~/.nargo/bin/nargo test           # Unit tests
~/aztec-bin/nargo compile         # Compilation

# For TypeScript
npm run lint                      # Linting
npm run type-check                # Type checking
npm test                          # Unit tests

# For any code changes
git diff                          # Review changes
```

---

## Testing Hierarchy

**All testing follows this order - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```
1. LOCAL SANDBOX (Aztec sandbox on your machine)
   └── Run: aztec start --sandbox
   └── Why: Fast iteration, no network issues, free

2. LOCAL FORK (Fork of devnet/mainnet state)
   └── Run: aztec start --fork https://next.devnet.aztec-labs.com
   └── Why: Real state, local speed

3. DEVNET (https://next.devnet.aztec-labs.com)
   └── Why: Public test environment
   └── ONLY after local tests pass

4. TESTNET (when available)
   └── Why: Pre-mainnet validation
   └── ONLY after devnet tests pass

5. MAINNET
   └── ONLY after full audit and all prior stages pass
```

sudo docker create --name extract-nargo aztecprotocol/aztec:latest
sudo docker cp extract-nargo:/usr/src/noir/noir-repo/target/release/nargo ~/aztec-bin/
sudo docker rm extract-nargo

# Compile a contract
cp -r /workspace/staking/aztec/contracts/liquid-staking-core ~/liquid-staking-core
cd ~/liquid-staking-core
~/aztec-bin/nargo compile
```

See: /workspace/staking/aztec/contracts/AGENT_HANDOFF.md

## PROMPT 2: Bot Infrastructure Agent

**Dependencies:** Contract interfaces (can start skeleton immediately)
**Run Immediately:** Skeleton yes, integration after contracts
**Testing Environment:** LOCAL SANDBOX FIRST, then devnet
**Estimated Time:** 20-30 hours

```text
You are a backend engineer building keeper bots for the Aztec liquid staking protocol.

## CONTEXT
- Protocol has 7 smart contracts (4 implemented, 3 in progress)
- Need 4 keeper bots: Staking, Rewards, Withdrawal, Monitoring
- Aztec is NOT EVM - do not use Ethereum libraries (viem, ethers)

## CRITICAL: LOCAL-FIRST DEVELOPMENT
1. Build and test against LOCAL SANDBOX first
2. Use mock data for contract interfaces not yet available
3. Run local Aztec sandbox: `aztec start --sandbox`
4. DO NOT interact with devnet until local tests pass

## YOUR TASKS
1. **Pre-flight:**
   - Review TASKS.md for TASK-301 through TASK-306
   - Check Aztec SDK documentation for client patterns

2. **Create bot project structure:**
   ```
   staking/aztec/bots/
   ├── staking-keeper/
   │   ├── src/index.ts
   │   ├── src/config.ts
   │   ├── src/__tests__/
   │   ├── package.json
   │   └── Dockerfile
   ├── rewards-keeper/
   ├── withdrawal-keeper/
   ├── monitoring/
   ├── shared/          # Shared utilities
   └── k8s/             # Kubernetes manifests
   ```

3. **Implement Staking Keeper:**
   - Watch for deposit events
   - Trigger batching at 200k threshold
   - Execute stake to validator
   - Error handling with exponential backoff

4. **Implement Rewards Keeper:**
   - Scheduled job (configurable interval)
   - Claim rewards from validators
   - Update exchange rate
   - Distribute protocol fees

5. **Implement Withdrawal Keeper:**
   - Monitor withdrawal queue
   - Process ready withdrawals
   - Manage liquidity buffer

6. **Implement Monitoring Bot:**
   - Validator health checks
   - TVL tracking
   - Prometheus metrics export
   - Alert integration (configurable)

7. **Add tests (MANDATORY):**
   - Unit tests for each bot (80%+ coverage)
   - Integration tests with mocked contracts
   - Run: `npm test` in each bot directory

## TECH STACK
- TypeScript/Node.js (ESM modules)
- AztecJS for chain interaction (NOT viem/ethers)
- BullMQ for job scheduling
- Prometheus for metrics
- Jest for testing

   - CPU, RAM, disk, bandwidth daily metrics
   - Calculate actual vs. estimated costs

5. **Update Documentation:**
   - ASSUMPTIONS.md Validation Log with all findings
   - Each finding: date, method, result, artifacts/links
   - Mark verified/unverified with evidence

## VALIDATION OUTPUT FORMAT
For each assumption, provide:
```
