# Aztec Staking Frontend

Local UI shell for the Aztec staking sandbox. It is intentionally minimal and
meant to be wired to local contract calls.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- The UI is mock data only.
- Pair with the local sandbox flow in `staking/aztec/scripts/local-sandbox-e2e.sh`.
