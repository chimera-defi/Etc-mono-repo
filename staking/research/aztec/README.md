## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

**Competitive Intelligence:**
Claims about "two teams building" are based on informal ecosystem communications and Aztec official blog posts. Olla (by Kryha) is the only confirmed competitor with public announcement.

**Cost Estimates:**
Infrastructure costs ($299/month) verified via vendor pricing pages. Validator costs ($400/month) are estimates based on Ethereum benchmarks - **must validate on Aztec testnet**.

**Revenue Projections:**
Based on 8% staking APR (estimated), 10% protocol fee (industry standard), and TVL assumptions. Actual results may vary significantly.
