# Aztec Liquid Staking — Competitor Tracker (Living Doc)

**Purpose:** Maintain a single, up-to-date view of competitors building Aztec liquid staking / fractional staking so strategy (pricing, differentiation, timeline) stays grounded.

**Status legend:** ✅ verified • ⚠️ plausible • ❌ unknown  
**Last updated:** Dec 24, 2025

## What we believe is true (as of this doc’s last update)

- **No dominant, production liquid staking token appears to be live yet** on Aztec (based on a best-effort desk scan; not exhaustive and must be re-checked periodically).
- **Olla (by Kryha)** is a **publicly referenced** competitor (see below).
- **Aztec has publicly stated multiple teams are working on fractional staking** (see Aztec blog source below).

## Competitor table (canonical)

| Project | Team | Status | Scope | Approach (hypothesis) | Differentiation | Evidence | Confidence | Next verification step |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Olla | Kryha | Announced / early | Liquid staking / fractional staking | Aztec-native protocol (details TBD) | First public mindshare | Featured at Aztec @Devconnect event | ✅ | Find repo/docs, timeline, whether they run validators vs marketplace |
| Team (unknown #2) | Unknown | Building | Fractional staking | Unknown | Unknown | Aztec blog says “multiple teams” | ⚠️ | Identify name via Aztec ecosystem channels (Discord, grants, GitHub, X) |
| Team (unknown #3) | Unknown | Building | Fractional staking | Unknown | Unknown | Aztec blog says “multiple teams” | ⚠️ | Same as above |

## Competitive watchlist (leads; not verified yet)

Use this section for “possible entrants” and track signals until they are either confirmed or ruled out.

| Lead | Why it’s plausible | Signal(s) to watch | Confidence | Next step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Existing LST operator expands to Aztec | Existing playbook + distribution | public hiring, Aztec grants, testnet deployments | ❌ | Search Aztec ecosystem announcements + GitHub orgs |
| Aztec-native DeFi team builds LST wrapper | LST becomes core primitive quickly | contracts mentioning “staking”, “delegation”, “LST”, “pool” | ❌ | Monitor Aztec repos + Discord dev channels |

## Notes (what matters for strategy)

When a competitor is confirmed, capture these fields (short bullets, not prose):
- **Launch window**: best estimate + why
- **Model**: self-run validators vs validator marketplace vs custodial delegation
- **Token**: reward-bearing vs rebasing; transferability constraints
- **Liquidity plan**: DEX pairs/incentives
- **Security posture**: audits, bug bounty, timelock
- **Distribution**: wallets/DeFi partners/foundation support
