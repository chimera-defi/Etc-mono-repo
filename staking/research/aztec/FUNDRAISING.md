## Pitch Deck Structure (12 slides)

### Slide 1: Cover
**stAZTEC Protocol**
*Liquid Staking for Aztec Network*

Tagline: "Unlock liquidity for 200,000 AZTEC stakers"

### Slide 2: Problem
**High barrier to Aztec staking**

- 200,000 AZTEC minimum ($6,000)
- Illiquid (7-day unbonding)
- Misses DeFi opportunities

Visual: Bar chart showing 70% of AZTEC holders have <200k tokens

### Slide 3: Solution
**stAZTEC: Liquid Staking Protocol**

1. Deposit any amount of AZTEC
2. Receive stAZTEC (liquid, tradable)
3. Earn 8% APR + maintain DeFi composability

### Slide 4: Market Opportunity
**$500M-$2B TAM**

- Aztec market cap: $1.5B-$3B
- Staking participation: 40-60%
- Liquid staking preference: 30-50% (Ethereum: 33%)

## Pitch Narrative (3-minute version)

**Hook (15 seconds):**
"Aztec just launched the first privacy-focused Ethereum L2 with native staking. There's $600M staked but no way to unlock that liquidity. We're building the Lido for Aztec."

**Problem (30 seconds):**
"To stake AZTEC, you need 200,000 tokens—that's $6,000. 70% of holders don't have that much. Even if you do, your AZTEC is locked for 7 days when you unstake. You can't use it in DeFi, can't trade it, can't collateralize it. That's a huge opportunity cost in a 200% APY DeFi ecosystem."

**Solution (30 seconds):**
"stAZTEC lets you deposit any amount of AZTEC and receive a liquid token that earns staking rewards. You can use stAZTEC everywhere—lend it, trade it, provide liquidity. Think Lido's stETH but for privacy-focused Aztec."

**Market (30 seconds):**
"Aztec has a $1.5B-$3B market cap. If 40% stake and 30% choose liquid staking, that's $180M-$540M in our TAM. On Ethereum, liquid staking is a $50B market. We're going after the same opportunity on Aztec before it gets crowded."

**Business Model (20 seconds):**
"We take 10% of staking rewards—that's the industry standard. At $100M TVL, we're doing $800k in annual revenue with 70% margins. We break even at $62M TVL, which is 10% of the staked supply. Very achievable."

**Competition (20 seconds):**
"There's one team we've identified: Olla by Kryha. They just announced at Devconnect but haven't launched. We have a 6-month window to ship first and capture 30-50% market share. In liquid staking, first-mover advantage is huge—Lido has 30% of Ethereum staking."

**Why Us (20 seconds):**
"We don't need to raise millions for AZTEC capital—users provide that. We just need to build the contracts and run the validators. Our team has Noir expertise, we've validated the tech on testnet, and we can ship in 6 months. Low capital intensity, high margin business."

**Ask (15 seconds):**
"We're raising $500k-$750k to get to mainnet. That covers contract development, two security audits, and 6 months of runway. We're talking to Pantera, Framework, and a few Aztec angels. Would love to have you involved."

## Objection Handling

### "Aztec is too new/unproven"
**Response:** "That's exactly why it's an opportunity. Ethereum liquid staking didn't exist until 2020. Lido launched when Ethereum staking was unproven and became a $20B protocol. We're at the same stage with Aztec. Early = risk, but also early = upside."

**Data:** Show Aztec fundraising ($100M+), team quality (Aztec Labs), Vitalik endorsement.

### "Olla will beat you to market"
**Response:** "Olla announced but hasn't shown a mainnet timeline. We've built a 6-month critical path. Even if they launch first, Lido wasn't first—stafi was. Execution and UX matter more than being #1. We're also vertically integrated (we run validators), which is a huge advantage."

**Data:** Show Lido market share despite late entry, our technical roadmap.

### "10% fee is too high"
**Response:** "Lido charges 10%. Rocket Pool charges 14%. It's the industry standard because validators need margins too. Users care more about APR (7.2% net after fees vs 0% on unbonded AZTEC) than the fee structure."

**Data:** Show competitor fee structures, user surveys preferring higher APR with fees vs lower without liquidity.

### "You need AZTEC capital to stake"
**Response:** "That's the old model. We pool user deposits into 200k batches and stake to OUR validators. Users delegate to us via smart contracts. We never need to own the AZTEC. It's pure software revenue."

**Data:** Show capital flow diagram, comparison to Lido (they don't own ETH either).

### "Noir is too new/risky"
**Response:** "Noir is production-ready—Aztec mainnet is live. We've validated contract patterns on testnet. We're budgeting for two audits (Trail of Bits + OpenZeppelin) to de-risk. Noir is actually simpler than Solidity for ZK primitives."

**Data:** Show Aztec mainnet stats, audit firm quotes, Noir documentation maturity.

### "Why do you need $500k?"
**Response:** "Two audits cost $100k. Hiring Noir devs costs $120k-$150k. We need 6 months of runway to get to mainnet. $500k is conservative—we'd rather over-capitalize than run out 2 months before launch."

**Data:** Show detailed budget breakdown, milestone-based fund releases.
