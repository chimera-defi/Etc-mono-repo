## Pitch Deck Structure (12 slides)

### Slide 1: Cover
**stAZTEC Protocol**
*Liquid Staking for Aztec Network*

Tagline: "Unlock liquidity for 200,000 AZTEC stakers"

### Slide 2: Problem
**High barrier to Aztec staking**

- 200,000 AZTEC minimum (~$8,000 at $0.04 sale-price baseline)
- Illiquid (unbonding period **TBD**; often cited as ~7 days, must verify on testnet)
- Misses DeFi opportunities

Visual: Bar chart showing “% of holders below 200k” (needs a defensible source or must be framed as an assumption)

### Slide 3: Solution
**stAZTEC: Liquid Staking Protocol**

1. Deposit any amount of AZTEC
2. Receive stAZTEC (liquid, tradable)
3. Earn 8% APR + maintain DeFi composability

Visual: User journey diagram (deposit → stAZTEC → DeFi)

### Slide 4: Market Opportunity
**TVL TAM (at sale-price baseline)**

- **Total supply:** 10.35B AZTEC
- **Sale-price baseline:** $0.04 → **~$414M FDV** (not a price forecast)
- **Staking participation:** 30-50% (scenario range; validate over time)
- **TVL TAM @ $0.04:** **$124M-$207M** (see `ECONOMICS.md`)
- **Liquid preference benchmark:** Ethereum ~33% liquid; Aztec is an assumption until measured

### Slide 5: Competition
**First-mover advantage**

| Protocol | Status | Launch |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **stAZTEC (us)** | Development | Q2 2026 |
| Olla (Kryha) | Announced | Unknown |
| Unknown Team | Rumored | Unknown |

Visual: Competitive positioning matrix (features vs. launch timeline)

### Slide 6: Business Model
**High-margin SaaS-like economics**

- **Revenue:** 10% of staking rewards
- **Costs (two models):**
  - **Protocol-only ops** (validators + infra): ~**$18k/year** (see `ECONOMICS.md`)
  - **Fully-loaded burn** (team + overhead while building/operating): **~$56k/month** (planning assumption)
- **Break-even (depends on definition):**
  - **Protocol-only:** **$2.25M TVL**
  - **Fully-loaded (rule of thumb):** **~$84M TVL** (at 8% APY, 10% fee)
- **Margins:** Very high on protocol-only costs; fully-loaded margins depend on headcount/pace

### Slide 7: Why We Win
**Capital efficiency + technical depth**

1. ✅ **$0 capital required** (users provide AZTEC)
2. ✅ **100% Noir implementation** (privacy-native)
3. ✅ **Vertically integrated** (self-operated validators)
4. ✅ **DeFi experience** (team background)

Visual: Comparison table vs. competitors

### Slide 8: Product & Tech
**Architecture**

- 6 Noir smart contracts
- 3-4 keeper bots
- Self-operated validators
- Privacy features (Phase 2)

Visual: System architecture diagram (simplified)

### Slide 9: Traction & Validation
**Testnet live, Olla confirmed competitor**

- ✅ Aztec testnet operational (May 2025)
- ✅ Competitive intel verified (Olla at Devconnect)
- ✅ Noir feasibility confirmed (token tutorial)
- ⚠️ Infra pricing sources compiled (AWS pricing pages); validator requirements/costs still require testnet measurement

Visual: Timeline of milestones achieved

### Slide 10: Roadmap
**6 months to mainnet**

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Team, testnet validation |
| 3-4 | Contract development |
| 5 | Security audits |
| 6 | Mainnet launch |

Visual: Gantt chart

## Pitch Narrative (3-minute version)

**Hook (15 seconds):**
"Aztec just launched the first privacy-focused Ethereum L2 with native staking. There’s already ~570M AZTEC staked (~$22.8M at the $0.04 sale-price baseline) but no liquid staking token yet. We’re building the Lido-for-Aztec primitive."

**Problem (30 seconds):**
"To stake AZTEC, you need 200,000 tokens—~$8,000 at the $0.04 sale-price baseline. Most holders won’t meet that minimum. Even if you do, staking is illiquid during unbonding (exact period TBD; often quoted ~7 days). Liquid staking solves this by letting users stay liquid while earning staking rewards."

**Solution (30 seconds):**
"stAZTEC lets you deposit any amount of AZTEC and receive a liquid token that earns staking rewards. You can use stAZTEC everywhere—lend it, trade it, provide liquidity. Think Lido's stETH but for privacy-focused Aztec."

**Market (30 seconds):**
"At the $0.04 sale-price baseline, Aztec’s fully diluted value is ~414M. If 30–50% of supply stakes, that’s ~$124M–$207M staked TVL at that baseline price. If even a fraction of that staking shifts to liquid, the first credible provider can become a core DeFi primitive on Aztec."

**Business Model (20 seconds):**
"We take 10% of staking rewards—that’s the industry standard. At $100M TVL, that’s ~$800k in annual revenue at 8% APY. Protocol-only ops break even around $2.25M TVL; fully-loaded break-even depends on team burn (rule of thumb ~$84M TVL at the same assumptions)."

*Note: “break-even” varies by cost model. Protocol-only break-even is far lower; fully-loaded break-even depends on team burn. See `ECONOMICS.md`.*

**Competition (20 seconds):**
"There's one team we've identified: Olla by Kryha. They just announced at Devconnect but haven't launched. We have a 6-month window to ship first and capture 30-50% market share. In liquid staking, first-mover advantage is huge—Lido has 30% of Ethereum staking."

**Why Us (20 seconds):**
"We don't need to raise millions for AZTEC capital—users provide that. We just need to build the contracts and run the validators. Our team has Noir expertise, we've validated the tech on testnet, and we can ship in 6 months. Low capital intensity, high margin business."

**Ask (15 seconds):**
"We're raising $500k-$750k to get to mainnet. That covers contract development, two security audits, and 6 months of runway. We're talking to Pantera, Framework, and a few Aztec angels. Would love to have you involved."

## Objection Handling

### "Aztec is too new/unproven"
**Response:** "That's exactly why it's an opportunity. Ethereum liquid staking didn't exist until 2020. Lido launched when Ethereum staking was unproven and became a $20B protocol. We're at the same stage with Aztec. Early = risk, but also early = upside."

**Data:** Show Aztec fundraising ($100M+), team quality (Aztec Labs), Vitalik endorsement.

### "Olla will beat you to market"
**Response:** "Olla announced but hasn't shown a mainnet timeline. We've built a 6-month critical path. Even if they launch first, Lido wasn't first—stafi was. Execution and UX matter more than being #1. We're also vertically integrated (we run validators), which is a huge advantage."

**Data:** Show Lido market share despite late entry, our technical roadmap.

### "10% fee is too high"
**Response:** "Lido charges 10%. Rocket Pool charges 14%. It's the industry standard because validators need margins too. Users care more about APR (7.2% net after fees vs 0% on unbonded AZTEC) than the fee structure."

**Data:** Show competitor fee structures, user surveys preferring higher APR with fees vs lower without liquidity.

### "You need AZTEC capital to stake"
**Response:** "That's the old model. We pool user deposits into 200k batches and stake to OUR validators. Users delegate to us via smart contracts. We never need to own the AZTEC. It's pure software revenue."

**Data:** Show capital flow diagram, comparison to Lido (they don't own ETH either).

### "Noir is too new/risky"
**Response:** "Noir is production-ready—Aztec mainnet is live. We've validated contract patterns on testnet. We're budgeting for two audits (Trail of Bits + OpenZeppelin) to de-risk. Noir is actually simpler than Solidity for ZK primitives."

**Data:** Show Aztec mainnet stats, audit firm quotes, Noir documentation maturity.

### "Why do you need $500k?"
**Response:** "Two audits cost $100k. Hiring Noir devs costs $120k-$150k. We need 6 months of runway to get to mainnet. $500k is conservative—we'd rather over-capitalize than run out 2 months before launch."

**Data:** Show detailed budget breakdown, milestone-based fund releases.
