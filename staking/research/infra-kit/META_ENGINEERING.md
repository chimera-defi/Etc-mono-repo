# InfraKit Meta‑Engineering Notes

## Prompt Structure
- **Grounding:** cite scripts and avoid assumptions.
- **Outputs:** specify which docs must be updated.
- **Format:** ASCII diagrams only.
- **Constraints:** no repetition; keep concise.

## Safety Against Hallucination
1) Only claim what is visible in scripts or docs.\n2) If unknown, mark as TBD or open question.\n3) Keep Aztec production roles out until scripts exist.
