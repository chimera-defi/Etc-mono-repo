# InfraKit Exact Summary

InfraKit is a shared ops layer that reuses common provisioning, hardening,
service management, and monitoring steps across validator chains, while
keeping each chain’s binaries/configs in thin adapters. The MVP is a repo‑based
control plane (scripts + runbooks) that enables fast, consistent onboarding of
Ethereum and Monad validators, with Aztec dev tooling documented until
production roles are defined.
