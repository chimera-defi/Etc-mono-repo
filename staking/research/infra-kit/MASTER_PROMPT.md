# InfraKit Master Prompt (Research → Design → Update)

Goal: Produce a script‑grounded, chain‑agnostic infra kit plan and design.

Steps:
1) Inspect eth2‑quickstart, Monad infra, and Aztec scripts.
2) Extract shared primitives vs chain‑specific adapters.
3) Update DESIGN/SPEC/PLAN/PRD with verified facts only.
4) Provide ASCII diagrams only (no Mermaid).
5) Keep docs concise and non‑repetitive.

Output:
- Updated DESIGN.md (high‑level + low‑level ASCII diagrams)
- Updated SPEC.md (script‑verified flows)
- Updated PRD.md (business framing)
