# Liquid Staking Landscape Research - 2025

**Research Date:** December 20, 2025
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of the liquid staking ecosystem to identify opportunities in institutional infrastructure, retail/degen markets, and emerging chains.

---

## Executive Summary

The liquid staking market has matured significantly with over **$66 billion locked** across platforms as of 2025. Ethereum dominates with 29% of supply staked (~34M ETH), while new paradigms like liquid restaking and multi-chain solutions are rapidly emerging. Key regulatory clarity from the SEC in May 2025 confirmed that certain liquid staking activities don't constitute securities offerings, accelerating institutional adoption.

**Market Structure:**
- **Liquid Staking:** 31.1% of all staked ETH
- **Centralized Exchanges:** 24.0% of staked ETH
- **Total Ethereum Validators:** 1.06 million active validators

- **Minimum Stake:** None (0 ETH minimum)
- **APR:** ~3%
- **Fee Structure:** 10% fee on all rewards
- **Node Operators:** Permissioned set of 30 professional entities

**Differentiators:**
- Deepest liquidity in DeFi
