## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case Scenario
- Find 2-4 direct affiliate programs
- Get approved for Amazon Associates
- Total: 3-5 affiliate programs ready to use

### Realistic Scenario
- Find 1-2 direct affiliate programs
- Get approved for Amazon Associates
- Send emails to others (may take time for responses)
- Total: 2-3 programs ready immediately, 2-3 pending

### Worst Case Scenario
- No direct programs found
- Amazon Associates approved
- Emails sent, waiting for responses
- Total: 1 program (Amazon) ready, others pending

**Even worst case is fine** - Amazon Associates covers most wallets and is reliable.

## Next Steps After Research

Once you have at least Amazon Associates (or 1-2 direct programs):

1. **Get affiliate IDs/tracking codes**
2. **Set up UTM tracking** (use Google's UTM builder)
3. **Create disclosure page** (`/affiliate-disclosure`)
4. **Test affiliate links** (make a test purchase if possible)
5. **Implement on WalletRadar** (add "Buy Now" buttons)
6. **Monitor conversions** (set up analytics)

## Tips

### Finding Contact Emails
- Check `/contact` page
- Check footer (often has email)
- Check LinkedIn company page
- Look for "Partnerships" or "Business Development" contacts

### What to Look For
- Commission rates (typically 5-15% for direct programs)
- Cookie duration (30-90 days is good, 24 hours is Amazon)
- Payment terms (monthly is standard)
- Minimum payout (some have $50-100 minimums)

### Red Flags
- Programs requiring upfront payment
- Programs with no tracking/analytics
- Programs that seem too good to be true (very high commissions)
- Programs requiring you to buy products first

## Time Estimate

- **Amazon Associates sign-up:** 30 minutes
- **Research 4 wallets:** 1-2 hours
