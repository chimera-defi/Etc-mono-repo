- ✅ **Krux (16.5%):** Good code quality
- ✅ **Blockstream Jade (20.1%):** Good code quality, active development
- ⚠️ **SeedSigner (22.5%):** Moderate — large community, many feature requests
- ⚠️ **Trezor (33.5%):** Higher ratio reflects large feature set and user base
- ⚠️ **Keystone (41.0%):** Moderate — newer project with active development
- 🔴 **OneKey (82.4%):** High ratio — many open issues relative to stars
- 🔴 **KeepKey:** No commits for 296 days — effectively abandoned

**Closed Source (no public firmware repos):** Ledger, NGRAVE, Ellipal, SafePal, SecuX, Tangem, BC Vault, GridPlus

**Firmware Release Patterns:**
Unlike software wallets where frequent updates can indicate instability, hardware wallet firmware updates are intentionally infrequent for security. Most manufacturers release 2-4 firmware updates per year. This is by design — each update requires extensive security review and user action to install.

| Wallet | Recent Releases (2025) | Pattern |
|--------|------------------------|---------|
| Keystone | 5 releases | ~1/month (active development) |
| Krux | 4 releases | ~1/quarter (active) |
| BitBox02 | 3-4 releases | ~1/quarter (stable) |
| Foundation Passport | 2 releases | ~1/quarter (stable) |
| SeedSigner | 2 releases | ~2/year (stable) |
| Specter DIY | 1 release | ~1/year (stable mature project) |
| OneKey | 3 releases | ~1/quarter (stable) |
| Blockstream Jade | Via tags | Continuous development |
| Trezor | Via Trezor Suite | App-managed updates |
| ColdCard | Via tags | Manual firmware downloads |

- ❌ **Cons:** No Secure Element (lower physical security), requires assembly, no manufacturer warranty

### ⚠️ Wallets to Avoid or Use with Caution

| Wallet | Score | Issue |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Ledger** (all models) | 55-57 | ⚠️ Ledger Recover capability — use with passphrase only |
| **Ellipal Titan** | 48 | Closed source, no Secure Element |
| **SecuX V20** | 47 | Closed source, unknown funding |
| **Arculus** | 42 | Closed source, NFC-only, no passphrase |

## ❓ Why Look Beyond Ledger?

**Ledger Recover (May 2023):** Firmware can extract and transmit seed phrase fragments to third-party custodians. Even if "optional," this capability violates the core principle that **private keys should NEVER leave the device**.

- 🔴 Firmware CAN extract seed — attack surface exists
- 🔴 Requires KYC — links identity to wallet  
- 🔴 2020 data breach exposed 272K users to phishing/physical threats

**If you must use Ledger:** Always enable passphrase (25th word) — Recover cannot extract this.

---

## 🔄 Ledger Migration

| From | To | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Nano S/S+ | Trezor Safe 3 | Same price, fully open source |
| Nano X | Trezor Safe 5 or Keystone 3 Pro | Better transparency or air-gapped |
| BTC holdings | ColdCard Mk4 | Maximum BTC security |

**Best practice:** Generate fresh seed on new device, then transfer assets (don't import Ledger seed).
