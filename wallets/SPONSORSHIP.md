# Sponsorship & Data Licensing

Last Updated: February 2026

Wallet Radar is independent, open source research. We keep the site free and avoid affiliate links. Sponsorships and data licensing help us cover research time, hosting, and data maintenance while protecting editorial independence.

## What We Do (and Do Not Do)

We do:
- Publish transparent scoring and sources.
- Accept sponsorships with clear disclosure.
- Offer data licensing for teams that need structured exports.

We do not:
- Add affiliate links or referral codes.
- Sell rankings, scores, or placements.
- Accept "pay to win" requests.

## Sponsorship Options

We currently support:
- **Homepage sponsorship callout** with disclosure.
- **Category sponsorship** (software, hardware, cards, ramps) with a public note.
- **Research support** for deep dives or new comparison tables.

All sponsorships are disclosed on the page where they appear.

## Data Licensing

If you need structured data for internal dashboards, research, or integrations:
- We can provide CSV or JSON exports.
- We can provide update cadences aligned to our research cycle.
- Custom data fields are possible when the underlying sources allow it.

## Editorial Independence

Sponsorships never change scores or recommendations. Our methodology and data sources remain public and verifiable.
