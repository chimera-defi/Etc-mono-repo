## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best crypto wallet for Ethereum developers?

Rabby Wallet (92/100) is the best wallet for Ethereum developers due to transaction simulation, scam detection, stable releases, and 120+ EVM chain support. However, keep MetaMask installed for compatibility testing.

### Do I need multiple wallets for development?

Yes, professional developers should use at least 2 wallets: (1) Rabby for daily development, (2) MetaMask for compatibility testing. Some also add Rainbow or Trust for additional coverage.

### What is transaction simulation and why does it matter?

Transaction simulation shows you the exact outcome of a transaction BEFORE you sign it. You see "you'll lose 100 ETH" instead of "call unknown function." This prevents costly mistakes in DeFi development. Only Rabby has full transaction simulation.

### Is MetaMask still necessary in 2026?

Yes. MetaMask has 90%+ market share and many dApps have MetaMask-specific code. While Rabby is better for development, MetaMask remains essential for compatibility testing before launch.

### Which wallet is best for smart contract testing?

Rabby Wallet (92) is best for smart contract testing due to transaction simulation. You can preview contract interactions before execution, catching bugs and malicious behavior early. Safe Wallet (87) is best for team-based contract deployments requiring multi-sig security.

### Can I use the same seed phrase across multiple wallets?

Yes, all wallets use standard BIP-39 mnemonics and BIP-44 derivation paths. You can import your seed phrase into Rabby, MetaMask, Rainbow, Trust, etc., and access the same accounts. However, use separate wallets for production vs testing funds.

### What about hardware wallet support for development?

All top wallets (Rabby, MetaMask, Rainbow, Trust) support Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. For development, use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments but software wallets for testnet testing (faster workflow).

### Which wallet has the best mobile development experience?

Rainbow (77) has the best mobile UX for Ethereum-only development. Trust Wallet (82) is best for multi-chain mobile development. Both have excellent mobile apps with built-in dApp browsers.

### How important is open source for development wallets?

Very important for security auditing and trust. However, all major wallets (Rabby, MetaMask, Rainbow, Trust) have partial open source - client code is open, but backend APIs are closed. This is acceptable for most developers.

### What if I'm building a multi-chain dApp?

Use Rabby (92) for EVM chains (120+ supported) or Trust (82) if you need Bitcoin, Solana, and other non-EVM chains. Test with multiple wallets since multi-chain dApps have higher compatibility requirements.
