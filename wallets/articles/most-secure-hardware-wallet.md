## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the most secure hardware wallet?

Trezor Safe 7 (96/100) is the most secure for long-term future-proof security with quantum-ready cryptography. ColdCard Mk4 (91/100) is most secure against current threats with full air-gap isolation. Keystone 3 Pro (91/100) offers air-gap security with multi-chain support.

### Do I need air-gap for maximum security?

Air-gap (ColdCard, Keystone) provides maximum security against malware by never connecting to internet-connected devices. However, Trezor Safe 7's Secure Element + open source also provides excellent security. Air-gap = maximum paranoid security, but slower UX.

### What is a Secure Element and why does it matter?

A Secure Element is a tamper-resistant chip that stores private keys. Even with physical access to the device, keys cannot be extracted. All three top wallets (Trezor Safe 7, ColdCard Mk4, Keystone 3 Pro) have Secure Elements. Wallets WITHOUT Secure Elements (SeedSigner, Krux) are less secure against physical attacks.

### Is open source firmware important for security?

Yes, critical. Open source allows independent security audits and community verification. All three most secure wallets are fully open source. Avoid closed-source wallets (Ledger, SafePal) where backdoors could exist undetected.

### Should I buy Ledger hardware wallets?

No. Ledger scores low (55-57/100) due to: (1) Partial closed-source firmware, (2) Ledger Recover controversy (optional key backup service), (3) Previous data breaches. Trezor, ColdCard, and Keystone are significantly more secure.

### What is quantum-ready cryptography?

Quantum computers (expected in 10-20 years) could break current encryption. Trezor Safe 7's Tropic01 Secure Element uses quantum-resistant algorithms to protect against future quantum attacks. Other wallets will need firmware updates when quantum threat becomes real.

### Can hardware wallets be hacked?

Properly designed hardware wallets (Trezor, ColdCard, Keystone) are extremely difficult to hack. Keys are stored in Secure Elements that resist physical extraction. Air-gapped wallets (ColdCard, Keystone) are immune to malware. Always buy from official manufacturers to avoid supply chain attacks.

### How much crypto should I keep in a hardware wallet?

Any amount you can't afford to lose. For long-term holdings over $10,000, hardware wallets are essential. For $100K+, consider multi-signature setups with multiple hardware wallets. For $1M+, consider institutional custody or advanced multi-sig.

### Do I need multiple hardware wallets?

Yes, for large holdings. Best practice: (1) Primary wallet for regular access, (2) Backup wallet for emergency recovery, (3) Different brand for supply chain diversification. Example: Trezor Safe 7 (primary) + ColdCard Mk4 (backup).

### What about DIY hardware wallets like SeedSigner?

DIY wallets (SeedSigner, Krux) lack Secure Elements, making them vulnerable to physical extraction attacks. They're good for learning but not recommended for large holdings. Trezor, ColdCard, and Keystone offer better security at reasonable prices.
