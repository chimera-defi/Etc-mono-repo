## Research Log

### December 8, 2025 - Initial Research Started
- Created research document
- Identified 8 primary hardware wallets to research
- Set up research methodology
- Performed initial website scans

### December 8, 2025 - Initial Website Scans
- **Trezor:** No obvious affiliate links found on homepage (may require deeper search or direct contact)
- **Ledger:** No obvious affiliate links found on homepage
- **Keystone:** No obvious affiliate links found on homepage
- **ColdCard:** No obvious affiliate links found on homepage
- **BitBox02:** Found "partners" mention in blog (Bitrefill partnership), but no affiliate program mentioned

### Research Findings Summary
Most hardware wallet manufacturers don't prominently display affiliate programs on their homepage. This is common - affiliate programs are often:
1. Hidden in footer links ("Partners", "Business", "Affiliate")
2. Require direct contact/application
3. May use third-party affiliate networks (Impact Radius, ShareASale, etc.)
4. May have partner programs instead of public affiliate programs
