## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Website Deep Dive (Do This First)

For each wallet manufacturer, check these locations:

#### 1. Footer Links
Look for these terms in the footer:
- "Affiliate"
- "Partners" / "Partner Program"
- "Referral"
- "Earn" / "Earn Money"
- "Business" / "Business Solutions"
- "Reseller"

#### 2. Sitemap / Site Search
- Visit `[wallet-site]/sitemap.xml`
- Search site for "affiliate" or "partner"
- Check "About" or "Business" pages

#### 3. Contact Pages
- Look for "Partnerships" contact email
- Check for "Business Inquiries" form
- Look for "Media" or "Press" contacts (they may know)

#### 4. Specific URL Patterns to Try
Try these URLs (replace `[wallet-site]` with actual domain):
- `[wallet-site]/affiliate`
- `[wallet-site]/affiliate-program`
- `[wallet-site]/partners`
- `[wallet-site]/partner-program`
- `[wallet-site]/referral`
- `[wallet-site]/business`
- `[wallet-site]/reseller`

---

## Phase 2: Google Search Strategy

Use these search queries (one at a time):

### Query 1: "[Wallet Name] affiliate program"
- Look for official pages
- Check Reddit discussions
- Look for blog posts about their affiliate program

### Query 2: "[Wallet Name] affiliate"
- Broader search
- May find third-party mentions

### Query 3: "[Wallet Name] partner program"
- Some companies call it "partner" not "affiliate"
- May find B2B partnership info

### Query 4: "[Wallet Name] referral program"
- Some companies have referral programs (different from affiliate)

### Query 5: "site:[wallet-domain] affiliate"
- Search within their site only
- May find hidden pages

---

## Phase 3: Third-Party Affiliate Networks

Some wallets may use affiliate networks. Check these:

### Impact Radius
- URL: https://www.impact.com
- Search for wallet names in their merchant directory
- Many crypto companies use this

### ShareASale
- URL: https://www.shareasale.com
- Search merchant directory
- Less common for crypto hardware

### CJ Affiliate (Commission Junction)
- URL: https://www.cj.com
- Search for wallet names
- Large network

### Rakuten Advertising
- URL: https://rakutenadvertising.com
- Search merchant directory
- Less common for crypto

### How to Check Networks:
1. Sign up for free account (if needed)
2. Search merchant directory
3. Look for wallet names
4. Note commission rates if found

---

## Phase 4: Direct Contact

If no public program found, email them directly.

### Email Template

**Subject:** Affiliate Partnership Inquiry - WalletRadar

**Body:**
```

[Your site receives X monthly visitors] - primarily developers and technical users researching wallet options.

If so, I'd love to learn more about:
- Commission structure

If you don't have a public program but are open to partnerships, I'd be happy to discuss options.

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
