## Regional Distribution

### Latin America ✅ **MOST DEVELOPED**
- **Argentina:** 5 confirmed services (mature market)
- **Brazil:** 2 services (Belo, Ripio - also operate in Argentina)
- **Why Argentina?** High inflation and currency instability drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks

### Global ⚠️ **LIMITED**
- **Valora:** Only confirmed global service
- Bank withdrawal via third-party (not direct integration)
- Mobile Money available in Africa

### Other Regions ❌ **NO MATCHES FOUND**
- **India:** Exchange models only (CoinDCX, WazirX), fiat-only UPI payments (PhonePe, Paytm)
- **Southeast Asia:** Fiat QR payments exist, but crypto is separate (GCash, PayMaya) or not available (OVO, GoPay, MoMo, ZaloPay, ViettelPay, TrueMoney, DANA, LinkAja, GrabPay)
- **Africa:** Exchange models (Luno, Valr), fiat mobile money (M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money, OPay), B2B processors (Flutterwave, Paystack), fiat remittance (Sendwave, WorldRemit), Yellow Card/Chipper Cash/Palm unclear

## Key Insights

### 1. Exchange/Wallet vs Payment Network
Most services found are **exchanges/wallets** (crypto trading + bank withdrawal) rather than **P2P payment networks** (QR-based instant transfers).

**Difference:**
- **Exchange/Wallet:** Users buy/sell crypto, withdraw to bank (like Coinbase)
- **Payment Network:** Users send crypto via QR code to other users instantly (like Peanut, Valora)

### 2. Fiat QR Payments vs Crypto QR Payments
Southeast Asia has mature **fiat QR payment systems** (GCash, PayMaya, QRIS, PromptPay), but these are **separate** from crypto features. Users can:
- Send fiat via QR ✅
- Trade crypto ✅
- But **cannot** send crypto via QR ❌ (or unclear)

### 3. On-Ramp/Off-Ramp vs P2P Network
Services like MoonPay and Ramp are **on-ramp/off-ramp** (buy/sell crypto with fiat), not **P2P payment networks** (send crypto to other users).

### 4. Regional Concentration
This category is **highly concentrated in Latin America**, especially Argentina, where economic conditions drive demand. Other regions have different models:
- **India/Southeast Asia:** Fiat QR payments (UPI, GCash, QRIS)
- **Africa:** Mobile Money (fiat) + some crypto exchanges
- **Europe/North America:** Neobanks or Bitcoin-focused services

## Conclusion

The "Stablecoin Payment Networks" category is **highly specialized** and **regionally concentrated**:

1. **Argentina is the clear leader** with 5 confirmed services offering direct bank integration
2. **Valora is the only global service** but uses third-party providers for bank withdrawal (less seamless)
3. **Other regions** primarily have exchange/wallet models or fiat-only QR payment systems, not integrated stablecoin QR payment networks

This suggests the category is **most viable in markets with**:
- High inflation/currency instability
- Strong mobile payment adoption
- Regulatory clarity around crypto payments
- Direct bank integration capabilities
