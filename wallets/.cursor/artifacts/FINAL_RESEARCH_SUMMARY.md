# Stablecoin Payment Networks - Final Research Summary

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Research Scope:** Global search for crypto-specific stablecoin payment networks (QR payments + bank withdrawal)  
**Focus:** Crypto-specific payment applications (NOT exchanges, NOT fiat-only apps, NOT wallets without payment features)

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Services Researched:** 110+  
**Confirmed Matches:** 6  
**Excluded:** 100+  
**Unclear:** 2 (Yellow Card, Chipper Cash - require manual app testing)

**Key Finding:** The "Stablecoin Payment Networks" category is **highly concentrated in Latin America**, especially Argentina, where economic conditions (high inflation, currency instability) drive strong demand for stablecoin-based payment networks. Other regions primarily have:
- Exchange/wallet models (crypto trading + bank withdrawal, but no QR-based P2P payments)
- Fiat-only QR payment systems (QR payments exist, but for fiat, not stablecoins)
- On-ramp/off-ramp services (buy/sell crypto, not P2P payment networks)

## Unclear (2 Services - Crypto-Specific Apps Requiring Deeper Research)

### Yellow Card (Africa)
- **Status:** ❓ **UNCLEAR - B2B FOCUS, CONSUMER FEATURES UNCLEAR**
- **Reason:** Website mentions "Stablecoin Payment Infrastructure" but unclear if consumer P2P QR payments exist
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Stablecoins (USDC/USDT likely based on "Stablecoin Payment Infrastructure")
  - ⚠️ B2B focus: "empowers global businesses in emerging markets"
  - ❓ Consumer P2P QR payments - unclear
  - ❓ Bank withdrawal - unclear
- **Assessment:** Appears to be B2B infrastructure focus ("empowers global businesses"), unclear if consumer P2P QR payments exist
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Check if consumer app exists (vs. B2B only)
  - Review app store descriptions
  - Verify consumer P2P QR payment features
  - Check bank withdrawal capabilities

  - ❓ Crypto/stablecoin support - unclear if stablecoin P2P QR payments exist
  - ❓ QR payments - unclear
  - ❓ Bank withdrawal - unclear
- **Assessment:** Payment service with crypto features mentioned, but unclear if it matches stablecoin QR payment network criteria
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Check App Store descriptions (iOS/Android)

  - Search for "QR code" + "stablecoin" + "Chipper Cash"
  - Verify if crypto payments are integrated or separate feature

### Excluded: Palm (Africa)
- **Status:** ❌ **NOT A MATCH**
- **Reason:** Business identity/compliance service (KYB, business filings), NOT a crypto payment app

## Regional Distribution

### Latin America ✅ **MOST DEVELOPED**
- **Argentina:** 5 confirmed services (mature market)
- **Brazil:** 2 services (Belo, Ripio - also operate in Argentina)
- **Why Argentina?** High inflation and currency instability drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks

### Global ⚠️ **LIMITED**
- **Valora:** Only confirmed global service
- Bank withdrawal via third-party (not direct integration)
- Mobile Money available in Africa

### Other Regions ❌ **NO MATCHES FOUND**
- **India:** Exchange models only (CoinDCX, WazirX), fiat-only UPI payments (PhonePe, Paytm)
- **Southeast Asia:** Fiat QR payments exist, but crypto is separate (GCash, PayMaya) or not available (OVO, GoPay, MoMo, ZaloPay, ViettelPay, TrueMoney, DANA, LinkAja, GrabPay)
- **Africa:** Exchange models (Luno, Valr), fiat mobile money (M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money, OPay), B2B processors (Flutterwave, Paystack), fiat remittance (Sendwave, WorldRemit), Yellow Card/Chipper Cash/Palm unclear
- **Europe:** Neobanks (Revolut, N26), fiat payment systems (Vipps, Swish, MobilePay, Bancontact, iDEAL, Sofort, Giropay, EPS), not crypto payment networks
- **North America:** Bitcoin-focused (Strike, Cash App) or on-ramp services (MoonPay, Ramp)
- **Middle East:** Exchanges (Rain, Coinmama) or exchange-based payment features (Binance Pay)

## Key Insights

### 1. Exchange/Wallet vs Payment Network
Most services found are **exchanges/wallets** (crypto trading + bank withdrawal) rather than **P2P payment networks** (QR-based instant transfers).

**Difference:**
- **Exchange/Wallet:** Users buy/sell crypto, withdraw to bank (like Coinbase)
- **Payment Network:** Users send crypto via QR code to other users instantly (like Peanut, Valora)

### 2. Fiat QR Payments vs Crypto QR Payments
Southeast Asia has mature **fiat QR payment systems** (GCash, PayMaya, QRIS, PromptPay), but these are **separate** from crypto features. Users can:
- Send fiat via QR ✅
- Trade crypto ✅
- But **cannot** send crypto via QR ❌ (or unclear)

### 3. On-Ramp/Off-Ramp vs P2P Network
Services like MoonPay and Ramp are **on-ramp/off-ramp** (buy/sell crypto with fiat), not **P2P payment networks** (send crypto to other users).

### 4. Regional Concentration
This category is **highly concentrated in Latin America**, especially Argentina, where economic conditions drive demand. Other regions have different models:
- **India/Southeast Asia:** Fiat QR payments (UPI, GCash, QRIS)
- **Africa:** Mobile Money (fiat) + some crypto exchanges
- **Europe/North America:** Neobanks or Bitcoin-focused services

## Conclusion

The "Stablecoin Payment Networks" category is **highly specialized** and **regionally concentrated**:

1. **Argentina is the clear leader** with 5 confirmed services offering direct bank integration
2. **Valora is the only global service** but uses third-party providers for bank withdrawal (less seamless)
3. **Other regions** primarily have exchange/wallet models or fiat-only QR payment systems, not integrated stablecoin QR payment networks

This suggests the category is **most viable in markets with**:
- High inflation/currency instability
- Strong mobile payment adoption
- Regulatory clarity around crypto payments
- Direct bank integration capabilities
