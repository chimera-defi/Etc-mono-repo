## Category Determination

Based on competitor analysis, these services share:
1. **Stablecoin/crypto support** (USDC, USDT, etc.)
2. **Bank withdrawal capabilities** (off-ramp to local fiat)
3. **P2P payment features** (send/receive)
4. **Mobile apps**
5. **Regional focus** (Argentina/Latin America)

### Key Insight: These are NOT pure on-ramps

**Critical Distinction:** These services are NOT pure fiat-to-crypto on-ramps. They are:
- **Hybrid services** that combine crypto wallets + bank integration
- **Regional crypto platforms** with banking features
- **Stablecoin payment systems** with off-ramp capabilities

### Category Options Analysis

#### Option 1: "Stablecoin Remittance Services" ❌
**Problem:** "Remittance" implies cross-border focus, but many competitors (Lemon Cash, Belo, Buenbit) are primarily domestic Argentina services.

#### Option 2: "Stablecoin Payment Apps" ⚠️
**Problem:** Too broad - could include Venmo-like services that don't use crypto.

#### Option 3: "Crypto-Enabled Banking Services" ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
**Definition:** Services that provide banking-like features (payments, remittances, bank withdrawals) using stablecoins/crypto, bridging crypto and traditional banking.

**Pros:**
- Captures banking-like features (payments, bank withdrawals)
- Emphasizes crypto/stablecoin usage
- Includes bank integration (off-ramp) - KEY differentiator
- Distinguishes from pure wallets (have bank integration) or exchanges (have payment focus)

**Cons:**
- "Banking" might imply full banking licenses (most don't have, but that's OK - they provide banking-like services)

#### Option 4: "Stablecoin Off-Ramp Services" ❌
**Problem:** "Off-ramp" implies pure conversion service, but these are full platforms with wallets, payments, etc.
