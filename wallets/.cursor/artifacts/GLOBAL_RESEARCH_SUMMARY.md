# Stablecoin Payment Networks - Global Research Summary

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Research Scope:** Find stablecoin payment networks (QR payments + bank withdrawal) beyond Argentina

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Confirmed Services:** 6
- **Argentina:** 5 services (Peanut, Lemon Cash, Belo, Ripio, Buenbit)
- **Global:** 1 service (Valora)

**Key Finding:** This category is most developed in Latin America, especially Argentina, where economic conditions drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks. Other regions (India, Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe) primarily have either exchange/wallet models or fiat-only QR payment systems, not integrated stablecoin QR payment networks.

## Confirmed Services

### Argentina (5 services)
1. **Peanut** - QR payments, USDC/USDT, bank withdrawal to ARS
2. **Lemon Cash** - QR payments, crypto, VISA card, bank withdrawal
3. **Belo** - QR payments, crypto, bank withdrawal (also Brazil)
4. **Ripio** - QR payments, crypto, VISA card, bank withdrawal (also Brazil)
5. **Buenbit** - QR payments, USDC, bank withdrawal

6. **Valora** (Global/Celo)

   - ✅ Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)
   - ✅ Bank withdrawal (via third-party providers, limited locations)
   - ✅ Mobile Money withdrawal (Africa)
   - ✅ Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
   - ⚠️ **Note:** Bank withdrawal is indirect (via third-party like Ramp), not direct bank integration like Argentina services

---

## Excluded Services

### Daimo (Global)
- ❌ **Reason:** Consumer app shut down November 2025
- ❌ **Current Status:** Only B2B Daimo Pay remains (routes deposits TO apps, not FROM apps)
- ❌ **Not a Match:** B2B infrastructure, not consumer P2P payment network

### Bitso (Latin America)
- ❌ **Reason:** Exchange/wallet model, not P2P payment network
- ❌ **Missing:** QR code payments not found in documentation
- ✅ **Has:** Stablecoins ("Digital Dollars"), bank withdrawal, mobile apps
- **Assessment:** Primarily a crypto exchange with wallet features, not a QR-based P2P payment network

---

## Regional Analysis

### Latin America ✅ **MOST DEVELOPED**
- **Argentina:** 5 confirmed services (mature market)
- **Brazil:** 2 services (Belo, Ripio - also operate in Argentina)
- **Mexico/Colombia:** Bitso operates but doesn't match criteria

**Why Argentina?** High inflation and currency instability drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks.

### Global ⚠️ **LIMITED**
- **Valora:** Only confirmed global service
- Bank withdrawal via third-party (not direct integration)
- Mobile Money available in Africa

### Other Regions ✅ **RESEARCHED**
- **India:** ❌ No matches found (CoinDCX, WazirX are exchanges, not P2P payment networks)
- **Southeast Asia:** ❌ No matches found (GCash, PayMaya have fiat QR + crypto separately, not integrated; OVO, GoPay are fiat-only)
- **Africa:** ❓ Yellow Card needs deeper research (B2B focus, unclear if consumer QR payments); Luno, Valr are exchanges
- **Europe:** ❌ No matches found (Revolut, N26 are neobanks, not crypto payment networks)

## Key Differences: Argentina vs Global

| Feature | Argentina Services | Valora (Global) |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **QR Payments** | ✅ Direct integration | ✅ Available |
| **Bank Withdrawal** | ✅ Direct bank integration | ⚠️ Via third-party (limited locations) |
| **Geographic Focus** | Single country (Argentina) | Global (but limited bank withdrawal) |
| **Mobile Money** | ❌ Not available | ✅ Available (Africa) |

**Insight:** Argentina services have direct bank integration, making them more like UPI. Valora uses third-party providers, making bank withdrawal less seamless.
