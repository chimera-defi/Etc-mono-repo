## Key Findings

### Category Definition Still Evolving

The "Stablecoin Payment Networks" category appears to be:
- **Highly specialized** - Only 6 confirmed matches globally
- **Regionally concentrated** - 5 of 6 are in Argentina
- **Specific feature set required:**
  - QR code payments for P2P transfers
  - Stablecoin support (USDC/USDT)
  - Bank withdrawal capability
  - Mobile apps

### Most Services Are NOT Matches

The vast majority of crypto-related services fall into these categories:
1. **Exchanges** - Trading platforms, not payment networks
2. **Fiat-only payment apps** - QR payments exist but for fiat, not crypto
3. **Wallets** - Storage solutions, not payment networks
4. **B2B infrastructure** - Business-focused, not consumer P2P
5. **On-ramp/off-ramp** - Buy/sell services, not P2P networks

### Services Requiring Deeper Investigation

     - Whether crypto payments are integrated or separate feature

2. **Yellow Card:**
   - ✅ Attempted App Store scraping (JavaScript-heavy, no useful results)

     - Bank withdrawal capabilities

3. **Other Potential Services:**
   - ✅ Completed: DeFi payment protocols research

## Category Definition Questions

As we're still figuring out what this category should be, consider:

1. **Should B2B-focused services be included?** (e.g., Yellow Card if it's B2B only)
2. **Should services with indirect bank withdrawal be included?** (e.g., Valora uses third-party providers)
3. **Should Bitcoin-focused services be considered?** (e.g., Strike uses Lightning Network)
4. **What's the minimum feature set required?** (QR + stablecoins + bank withdrawal seems to be the baseline)

---

**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025  
**Research Status:** Parallel research completed - No new matches found. Chipper Cash and Yellow Card remain unclear and require manual app testing for definitive verification.
