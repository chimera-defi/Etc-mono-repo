  - Whether crypto payments are integrated or separate

#### Yellow Card

  - Bank withdrawal capabilities for consumers

#### Palm

## Key Findings

### Category Definition Still Evolving

The "Stablecoin Payment Networks" category appears to be:
- **Highly specialized** - Only 6 confirmed matches globally
- **Regionally concentrated** - 5 of 6 are in Argentina
- **Specific feature set required:**
  - QR code payments for P2P transfers
  - Stablecoin support (USDC/USDT)
  - Bank withdrawal capability
  - Mobile apps

### Most Services Are NOT Matches

The vast majority of crypto-related services fall into these categories:
1. **Exchanges** - Trading platforms, not payment networks
2. **Fiat-only payment apps** - QR payments exist but for fiat, not crypto
3. **Wallets** - Storage solutions, not payment networks
4. **B2B infrastructure** - Business-focused, not consumer P2P
5. **On-ramp/off-ramp** - Buy/sell services, not P2P networks

### Services Requiring Deeper Investigation

1. **Chipper Cash** (Africa) - Has crypto features, needs verification for stablecoin P2P QR payments
2. **Yellow Card** (Africa) - B2B focus, unclear if consumer P2P QR payments exist

---

## Next Steps for Deeper Research

1. **Chipper Cash:**
   - Check App Store descriptions (iOS/Android)
   - Review user documentation/help pages
   - Search for "QR code" + "stablecoin" + "Chipper Cash"
   - Verify if crypto payments are integrated or separate feature

2. **Yellow Card:**
   - Check if consumer app exists (vs. B2B only)
   - Review app store descriptions
   - Verify consumer P2P QR payment features
   - Check bank withdrawal capabilities

3. **Other Potential Services:**
   - Search for DeFi payment protocols
   - Look for crypto remittance apps beyond exchanges
   - Research P2P crypto payment apps in other regions
   - Check for services that may have been missed

## Category Definition Questions

As we're still figuring out what this category should be, consider:

1. **Should B2B-focused services be included?** (e.g., Yellow Card if it's B2B only)
2. **Should services with indirect bank withdrawal be included?** (e.g., Valora uses third-party providers)
3. **Should Bitcoin-focused services be considered?** (e.g., Strike uses Lightning Network)
4. **What's the minimum feature set required?** (QR + stablecoins + bank withdrawal seems to be the baseline)
