## Research Methodology

**Approach:**
1. Identified known services from Argentina (baseline)
2. Searched for similar services in other regions
3. Verified features against criteria: QR payments + stablecoins + bank withdrawal
4. Categorized by region and verification status

**Challenges:**
- Many websites are JavaScript-heavy, making automated scraping difficult
- Some services may have features not clearly documented on public websites
- Need manual verification for QR payment support and bank withdrawal details

**Next Research Steps:**
1. Manual verification of Valora, Daimo, Bitso features
2. Research India crypto payment ecosystem
3. Research Southeast Asia crypto payment apps
4. Research Africa crypto payment services
5. Cross-reference with crypto payment industry reports

## Summary

**Confirmed Services:** 6
- **Argentina (5):** Peanut, Lemon Cash, Belo, Ripio, Buenbit
- **Global (1):** Valora (bank withdrawal via third-party, limited locations)

**Excluded:** 2
- **Daimo** - Consumer app shut down, B2B only
- **Bitso** - Exchange/wallet model, QR payments not found

**Potential Matches:** 5+ (need research)
- Various services in India, Southeast Asia, Africa

**Key Insight:** This category appears to be most developed in Latin America (especially Argentina), where high inflation and currency instability drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks. 

**Global Services Found:**
- **Valora** (Global) - Confirmed match, but bank withdrawal is via third-party providers in limited locations (not direct bank integration like Argentina services)
- Most other global services are either exchanges/wallets or B2B infrastructure, not consumer P2P payment networks

**Regional Distribution:**
- **Argentina:** 5 confirmed services (most mature market)
- **Brazil:** 2 services (Belo, Ripio - also operate in Argentina)
- **Global:** 1 service (Valora - indirect bank withdrawal)
- **Other regions:** Need deeper research (India, Southeast Asia, Africa)
