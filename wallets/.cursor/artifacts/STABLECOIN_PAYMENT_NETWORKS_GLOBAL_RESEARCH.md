## Research Methodology

**Approach:**

2. Searched for similar services in other regions
3. Verified features against criteria: QR payments + stablecoins + bank withdrawal
4. Categorized by region and verification status

- Need manual verification for QR payment support and bank withdrawal details

**Next Research Steps:**

**Potential Matches:** 5+ (need research)

**Key Insight:** This category appears to be most developed in Latin America (especially Argentina), where high inflation and currency instability drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks. Other regions may have fewer services matching all criteria.
