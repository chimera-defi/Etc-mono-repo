## Research Methodology

**Approach:**
1. Identified known services from Argentina (baseline)
2. Searched for similar services in other regions
3. Verified features against criteria: QR payments + stablecoins + bank withdrawal
4. Categorized by region and verification status
5. Extended research across Vietnam, other Southeast Asian countries, Africa, Middle East, and other crypto payment apps

**Challenges:**
- Many websites are JavaScript-heavy, making automated scraping difficult
- Some services may have features not clearly documented on public websites
- Need manual verification for QR payment support and bank withdrawal details
- Cloudflare protection on many sites prevented direct scraping

**Research Completed:**
1. ✅ Manual verification of Valora, Daimo, Bitso features
2. ✅ Research India crypto payment ecosystem
3. ✅ Research Southeast Asia crypto payment apps
4. ✅ Research Africa crypto payment services
5. ✅ Extended research across additional regions and service types

## Summary

**Confirmed Services:** 6
- **Argentina (5):** Peanut, Lemon Cash, Belo, Ripio, Buenbit
- **Global (1):** Valora (bank withdrawal via third-party, limited locations)

**Total Services Researched:** 110+  
**Excluded:** 100+ (exchanges, wallets, fiat-only services, B2B processors, remittance services, DeFi protocols, Bitcoin-focused services, defunct/parked domains)  
**Unclear:** 2 (Yellow Card, Chipper Cash - require manual app testing)

**Key Insight:** This category is **highly specialized and regionally concentrated** in Latin America (especially Argentina), where high inflation and currency instability drive demand for stablecoin-based payment networks. Extended research across Vietnam, other Southeast Asian countries, Africa, Middle East, and other crypto payment apps found **no additional matches**. Latest parallel research (DeFi protocols, crypto remittances, Latin America beyond Argentina, Asia beyond fiat, Europe, North America) also found **no new matches** - all investigated services were either fiat-only, Bitcoin-focused, B2B processors, or defunct/parked domains.

**Global Services Found:**
- **Valora** (Global) - Confirmed match, but bank withdrawal is via third-party providers in limited locations (not direct bank integration like Argentina services)
- Most other global services are either exchanges/wallets, B2B infrastructure, or fiat-only services, not consumer P2P payment networks

**Regional Distribution:**
- **Argentina:** 5 confirmed services (most mature market)
- **Brazil:** 2 services (Belo, Ripio - also operate in Argentina)
- **Global:** 1 service (Valora - indirect bank withdrawal)
- **Other regions:** No matches found (India, Southeast Asia, Africa, Middle East, North America, Europe)
