## ⚠️ "Friendly" vs "Native"
*   **Native:** You can hold BTC/ETH directly in your bank account (e.g., Juno, Xapo, FV Bank).
*   **Friendly:** They don't block you from sending money to Coinbase/Kraken (e.g., Mercury, Ally).
*   **Hostile:** Often block crypto transactions (e.g., Chase, Wells Fargo, HSBC often cited as difficult).

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### Juno (US)
*   **Why:** Closest thing to a "checking account on-chain".
*   **Features:** Direct on-ramp to Layer 2s (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism). Zero Coin Architecture.
*   **Risk:** Relies on partner bank (Evolve Bank & Trust) for FDIC insurance.

### Revolut (Global)
*   **Why:** Super app convenience.
*   **Limitation:** "Crypto Spend" often converts to fiat at point of sale. Withdrawals to external wallets are supported but can have limits or require paid plans.

### Mercury (US Business)
*   **Why:** They "get" tech. If you are a crypto startup (SAAS/Tooling) raising VC money, this is the default.
*   **Restriction:** Generally does NOT accept Money Service Businesses (MSBs) or issuers without specific approval.

### Xapo (Global)
*   **Why:** Fully licensed bank in Gibraltar. Not just a fintech wrapper.
*   **Niche:** Wealth preservation. USD accounts earning interest + Bitcoin accounts.
