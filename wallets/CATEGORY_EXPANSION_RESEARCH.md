## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Discovery (Current)
- Identify potential categories
- List initial entities per category
- Define key metrics
- Create research questions

### Phase 2: Data Collection (Child Agents)
- Research each category in parallel
- Collect data on entities
- Verify information from official sources
- Document data sources

### Phase 3: Analysis
- Compare categories for feasibility
- Assess data availability
- Evaluate scoring methodology needs
- Identify integration requirements

### Phase 4: Recommendation
- Prioritize categories by:
  - Market size
  - Developer/user demand
  - Data availability
  - Integration complexity
  - Uniqueness vs existing categories

---

## Success Criteria

For each category, we need:
1. **Comprehensive entity list** (20+ entities minimum)
2. **Key metrics defined** (aligned with existing wallet comparison structure)
3. **Scoring methodology** (0-100 scale, developer/user focused)
4. **Data sources identified** (official APIs, websites, documentation)
5. **Integration plan** (how to add to frontend/backend)
6. **Sample data** (5-10 entities with complete data)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create research plan (this document)
2. ⏳ Create agent prompts for each category
3. ⏳ Trigger child agents to research each category
4. ⏳ Consolidate research results
5. ⏳ Create executive summary with recommendations
