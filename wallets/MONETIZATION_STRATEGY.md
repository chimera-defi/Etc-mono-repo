## Monetization Strategies

### 🥇 Tier 1: High-Value, Low-Friction (Start Here)

#### 1. **Affiliate Links (Hardware Wallets)**
**Revenue Potential:** $50-200 per sale  
**Implementation:**
- Add affiliate links to hardware wallet purchase buttons
- Partner with: Trezor, Ledger, Keystone, ColdCard, BitBox02
- Use affiliate programs: Amazon Associates, manufacturer direct programs
- **Disclosure:** "We may earn a commission if you purchase through our links"

**Why It Works:**
- Natural fit (users are researching purchases)
- Non-intrusive (only on purchase intent pages)
- High-value transactions ($50-400 per device)
- Maintains objectivity (scores don't change based on affiliate status)

**Best Practices:**
- Only link to wallets you've reviewed
- Show affiliate disclosure clearly
- Link to multiple retailers when possible
- Track conversion rates to optimize placement

**Estimated Revenue:** $500-2,000/month (at 100-500 visitors/month, 1-2% conversion)

---

#### 2. **Sponsored Wallet Listings (Ethical)**
**Revenue Potential:** $500-2,000/month per wallet  
**Implementation:**
- Offer "Featured" or "Sponsored" badges (clearly marked)
- Sponsored wallets appear in a separate "Sponsored" section
- **No impact on scores** - scores remain objective
- Include disclosure: "Sponsored listings do not affect our scoring methodology"

**Why It Works:**
- Wallets want visibility (especially newer ones)
- Developers understand sponsored content
- Maintains trust through transparency
- Can charge premium for featured placement

**Best Practices:**
- Keep sponsored section separate from main comparison
- Require minimum score threshold (e.g., ≥60) for sponsorship
- Rotate sponsored listings monthly
- Provide analytics to sponsors (impressions, clicks)

**Estimated Revenue:** $1,000-5,000/month (2-5 sponsored wallets)

---

#### 3. **API Access / Data Licensing**
**Revenue Potential:** $100-1,000/month per enterprise customer  
**Implementation:**

  - **Free:** 1,000 requests/month (with attribution)
  - **Pro:** $99/month - 10,000 requests/month
  - **Enterprise:** $499/month - Unlimited + webhooks + custom fields

**Why It Works:**

- High-value for B2B customers

#### 11. **Wallet Certification Program** ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

- **Overreaching:** Damages credibility, seen as "pay for certification"
- **Competitive disadvantage:** Can't compete with real audit firms (Trail of Bits, etc.)

**Alternative: Custom Research Reports**
Instead of certification, offer:
- **Custom research reports:** $2,000-5,000 per report
- **Private wallet evaluations:** For enterprises choosing wallets
- **Integration consulting:** Help companies integrate wallets
- **Security analysis:** Partner with real audit firms (referral, not certification)

**Focus on what WalletRadar does well:** Comparison and analysis, not security certification.

**Why It Works:**
- Natural partnerships
- Win-win for both parties
- Low maintenance
- Builds ecosystem relationships

**Best Practices:**
