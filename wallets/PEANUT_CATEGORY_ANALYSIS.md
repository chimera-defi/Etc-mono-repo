## Category Determination

### Why NOT Other Categories?

| Category | Why Peanut Doesn't Fit |
|---------|------------------------|
| **On-Ramps** | ❌ Not pure fiat→crypto conversion (has wallet, payments) |
| **Off-Ramps** | ❌ Not pure crypto→fiat conversion (has wallet, payments) |
| **P2P Payment Apps** | ❌ Missing bank withdrawal (key differentiator) |
