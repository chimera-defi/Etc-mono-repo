## Executive Summary

### Key Finding: **Most wallets are sold DIRECT, not on Amazon**

**Critical Insight:** Unlike consumer electronics, hardware wallets are primarily sold through:
1. **Direct manufacturer websites** (trezor.io, ledger.com, coldcard.com, etc.)
2. **Specialized crypto retailers** (limited)
3. **Amazon** (some wallets, but not primary channel)

**Best Path Forward:** 
1. **Start with Amazon Associates** (covers wallets available on Amazon)
2. **Contact manufacturers directly** for affiliate partnerships (higher commissions)
3. **Use direct links** as fallback (no commission, but better UX)
