## Key Insights from Critical Analysis

### Pro Subscription - Why It Works
**Key Differentiator:** Historical score tracking
- No competitor offers this
- High value for decision-making
- Unique selling point

**Value Stack:**
1. Historical tracking (unique)
2. Export capabilities (team collaboration)
3. Email alerts (proactive monitoring)
4. Advanced filtering (time-saving)
5. API access (entry-level)

**Pricing:** $9/month or $90/year
**Target:** 50-200 subscribers = $500-2,000/month

### API Access - Why It Works
**Use Cases:**
- dApps recommending wallets to users
- Companies building internal dashboards
- Tools integrating wallet data
- Researchers analyzing ecosystem

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Free: 1,000 requests/month (with attribution)
- Pro: $99/month - 10,000 requests/month
- Enterprise: $499/month - Unlimited

**Target:** 5-30 API customers = $500-3,000/month

### Job Board - Why Defer
**Challenges:**
- Need traffic first (chicken-and-egg)
- Developers don't come for jobs
- Competitive market
- Low priority vs. core monetization

**When to Revisit:** Month 6+ when traffic is 10K+/month

### Enterprise Certification - Why Skip
**Problems:**
- WalletRadar isn't a security firm

- Seen as "pay for certification"
- Damages credibility

**Alternative:** Custom research reports ($2,000-5,000 per report)
