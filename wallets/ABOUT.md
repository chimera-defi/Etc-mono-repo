# About Wallet Radar

## Our Mission

Wallet Radar is an **independent, educational research platform** dedicated to providing objective, comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrency wallets, payment solutions, and blockchain tools.

We are **not** affiliated with any wallet providers, exchanges, or financial institutions. We exist to help developers and blockchain users make informed decisions through transparent, open-source research.

## What We Do

- **Compare wallets** - Analyze 24+ software wallets, 23+ hardware wallets, and 27+ crypto payment cards
- **Track development activity** - Monitor GitHub commits, releases, and maintenance frequency
- **Review security** - Document audit status, security features, and architectural choices
- **Evaluate user experience** - Assess developer tools, transaction simulation, and platform support
- **Publish methodology** - Show all our scoring logic and data sources for transparency

## Data Sources

Our research draws from:

- **GitHub API** - Repository activity, release frequency, open source status
- **WalletBeat** - Wallet technical specifications and features
- **Security audits** - Published audit reports from reputable firms
- **Community research** - Verified data from wallet documentation
- **Independent testing** - Hands-on evaluation of wallet features

## Why Independence Matters

The crypto wallet space is dominated by affiliate programs and sponsored content. Wallet Radar exists to provide an alternative:

- **No affiliate links** - We don't profit from wallet recommendations
- **Open source code** - View our methodology on GitHub
- **Community-driven** - Contribute corrections and improvements via GitHub Issues
- **Transparent scoring** - All comparison metrics are documented and reproducible
- **Educational focus** - We explain *why* features matter, not just *what* is available

## Common Questions

**Q: Are you affiliated with any wallet providers?**
A: No. We are completely independent and do not receive funding, sponsorship, or compensation from wallet providers.

**Q: Why was I warned about phishing?**
A: Chrome's Safe Browsing sometimes flags new educational sites about wallets with false positives. This is a reputational issue with our new domain, not a security issue. We are working to improve our domain reputation. See our [security information](/.well-known/security.txt).

**Q: Can I trust this data?**
A: We maintain high standards for accuracy and transparency. All data is sourced from official repositories and published research. However, this is educational research, not financial advice. Always verify critical information independently.

**Q: How do I report an error?**
A: Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/chimera-defi/Etc-mono-repo/issues) or [email us](mailto:chimera_deFi@protonmail.com).

**Q: Can I contribute?**
