# About Wallet Radar

## Our Mission

Wallet Radar is an **independent, educational research platform** dedicated to providing objective, comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrency wallets, payment solutions, and blockchain tools.

We are **not** affiliated with any wallet providers, exchanges, or financial institutions. We exist to help developers and blockchain users make informed decisions through transparent, open-source research.

## What We Do

- **Compare wallets** - Analyze 24+ software wallets, 23+ hardware wallets, and 27+ crypto payment cards
- **Track development activity** - Monitor GitHub commits, releases, and maintenance frequency
- **Review security** - Document audit status, security features, and architectural choices
- **Evaluate user experience** - Assess developer tools, transaction simulation, and platform support
- **Publish methodology** - Show all our scoring logic and data sources for transparency

## Data Sources

Our research draws from:

- **GitHub API** - Repository activity, release frequency, open source status
- **WalletBeat** - Wallet technical specifications and features
- **Security audits** - Published audit reports from reputable firms
- **Community research** - Verified data from wallet documentation
- **Independent testing** - Hands-on evaluation of wallet features

## Why Independence Matters

The crypto wallet space is dominated by affiliate programs and sponsored content. Wallet Radar exists to provide a completely independent alternative:

- **Zero financial incentives** - We don't profit from wallet recommendations, affiliate commissions, or sponsorships
- **No commercial relationships** - Completely independent of all wallet providers and financial institutions
- **Open source code** - Full transparency: view and audit our methodology on GitHub
- **Community-driven** - Contribute corrections and improvements via public GitHub Issues
- **Transparent scoring** - All comparison metrics are documented, reproducible, and auditable
- **Educational focus** - We explain *why* features matter, not just *what* is available
- **No credential collection** - We never ask for passwords, seed phrases, or personal information

## Common Questions

**Q: Are you affiliated with any wallet providers?**
A: No. We are completely independent and do not receive funding, sponsorship, or compensation from wallet providers.

**Q: Why was I warned about phishing?**
A: This is a false positive. Chrome's Safe Browsing uses heuristics that sometimes incorrectly flag new educational sites about wallets and cryptocurrencies. This is NOT a security issue with our site. We do NOT phish for passwords, collect wallets, or have login pages. We are working to improve our domain reputation through backlinks, age, and transparency. See our [security information](/.well-known/security.txt) and [trust signals](/#why-were-not-phishing) for verification.

**Q: Can I trust this data?**
A: We maintain high standards for accuracy and transparency. All data is sourced from official repositories and published research. However, this is educational research, not financial advice. Always verify critical information independently.

**Q: How do I report an error?**
A: Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/chimera-defi/Etc-mono-repo/issues) or [email us](mailto:chimera_deFi@protonmail.com).

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Yes! We welcome contributions. Check out the [contributing guidelines](/docs/contributing).
