    "prompt": "CONTEXT: We are operating a mission-critical production microservice architecture with multiple upstream services distributed across different availability zones. Recently, we have been experiencing intermittent 502 Bad Gateway errors originating from our nginx reverse proxy with TLS upstream checks failing periodically. The issue manifests with varying frequency - sometimes it happens during peak load periods when we see 10,000+ requests per second, but it also occurs sporadically during off-peak hours with minimal traffic. Our monitoring systems show that TCP connection timeouts are increasing, and certificate validation failures are being logged. We have recently updated TLS certificates and made changes to the upstream service configurations. The error rate has been approximately 0.5-2% of requests over the past 48 hours. We need to determine whether this is a configuration issue that can be resolved locally with standard debugging techniques, or whether it requires escalation to our premium support team for deeper infrastructure analysis and TLS certificate management assistance.\n\nTASK: Return ONLY valid JSON with exactly two fields: {\"route\":\"local|premium\", \"reason\":\"detailed explanation\"}.
