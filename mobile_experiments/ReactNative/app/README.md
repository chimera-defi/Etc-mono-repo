# React Native App Workspace

Future code lives here (e.g., `ValdiParity/`). Do not add source yet; this repository currently tracks planning only.

Suggested structure after `npx react-native init ValdiParity --template react-native-template-typescript`:
```
app/
└── ValdiParity/
    ├── App.tsx
    ├── android/
    ├── ios/
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json
```
Use this README to note any deviations once the project is generated.
