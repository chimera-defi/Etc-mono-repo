|----|--------|-------------|
| RN-1 | ⏳ | Install prerequisites (Node, watchman, JDK, Android Studio, Xcode) following `SETUP.md`. |

| RN-3 | 💤 | Scaffold `app/ValdiParity` with the TypeScript template (pending "ok to add code"). |
| RN-4 | 💤 | Customize the Hello World screen per `HELLO_WORLD_PLAN.md` once code work is allowed. |
| RN-5 | 💤 | Launch on Android emulator + iOS simulator; capture screenshots/logs and update `DOCUMENTATION.md`. |

Legend: ✅ done, ⏳ in progress, ⚠ blocked, 💤 deferred.
