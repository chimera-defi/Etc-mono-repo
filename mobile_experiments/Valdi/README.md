# Valdi Hello World App

This is a basic boilerplate for experimenting with Valdi, Snapchat's cross-platform mobile app framework.

## Getting Started

Valdi is Snapchat's cross-platform framework for building iOS, Android, and macOS applications. This project serves as a starting point for exploring Valdi's capabilities.

**Status**: ✅ Code updated with real Valdi syntax. Ready for installation and testing.

## Project Structure

## Hello World App

The hello world app demonstrates basic Valdi functionality and serves as a foundation for further experimentation.

## Next Steps

1. Install Valdi SDK/tools (when available)
2. Set up development environment
3. Build and run the hello world app
4. Explore Valdi's features and capabilities

## Resources

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi
- **Installation**: `npm install -g @snap/valdi`
- **CLI Commands**: `valdi dev_setup`, `valdi bootstrap`, `valdi hotreload`
- [Framework Comparison](../FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md) - Compare Valdi with other cross-platform frameworks

## Important Notes

- ✅ Code uses **actual Valdi syntax** (verified against GitHub repo)
- ✅ Files use `.tsx` extension (not `.valdi`)
- ✅ Class-based components with `onRender()` method
- ✅ Lowercase tags: `<view>`, `<label>` (not React's `<View>`, `<Text>`)
- ⚠️ Installation and testing pending - see `HANDOFF.md` for next steps
