# Agent Handoff Document - Valdi Project

## Quick Start for Next Agent

**Location**: `/workspace/mobile_experiments/Valdi/`

**Current Status**: Boilerplate created with placeholder code. Ready for discovery and implementation.

**Primary Goal**: Get a working "Hello World" app running with actual Valdi framework.

## What Has Been Done

✅ Created project structure
✅ Added placeholder hello world code
✅ Set up configuration files
✅ Created documentation framework
✅ Organized repository with cursor rules

## What Needs to Be Done

🔍 **CRITICAL**: Find actual Valdi documentation and API
📝 Update code to use real Valdi syntax
🔧 Install Valdi SDK/tools
🚀 Build and run hello world app
📚 Document findings and learnings

## Key Files to Review

1. **TASKS.md** - Detailed task breakdown
2. **UNDERSTANDING.md** - Framework understanding and research strategy
3. **DOCUMENTATION.md** - Placeholder for discovered documentation
4. **src/App.valdi** - Main app file (needs real Valdi syntax)
5. **SETUP.md** - Setup guide (needs actual installation steps)

## Important Notes

### Current Code is Placeholder
⚠️ **WARNING**: All `.valdi` files currently use React-like placeholder syntax. This is NOT the actual Valdi API. The code will need to be rewritten once the real API is discovered.

### Research First
Before attempting to run or build:
1. Search for official Valdi documentation
2. Find installation instructions
3. Locate API reference or examples
4. Understand the actual syntax

### Expected Challenges
- Valdi may be very new with limited public documentation
- Installation method is unknown
- API syntax is completely unknown
- May require specific development environment setup

```

### Where to Start

1. **Read TASKS.md** - Understand full task breakdown
2. **Read UNDERSTANDING.md** - Understand research strategy
3. **Search for Valdi docs** - Start with developers.snap.com
4. **Update code** - Once API is discovered
5. **Test and document** - Get it running and document learnings

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Hello world app runs on iOS simulator
- [ ] Code uses actual Valdi API (not placeholders)
- [ ] Documentation reflects real framework
- [ ] Clear assessment of framework ease of use

## Questions to Answer

1. What is Valdi's actual syntax?
2. How do you install Valdi?
3. How do you build and run Valdi apps?
4. What are Valdi's main features?
5. How easy is it to use compared to alternatives?
