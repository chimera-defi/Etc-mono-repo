# Flutter App Workspace

Run all `flutter` commands from inside this directory. Recommended layout once `flutter create hello_flutter` is executed:

```
app/
└── hello_flutter/
    ├── lib/
    │   └── main.dart
    ├── test/
    │   └── widget_test.dart
    ├── ios/
    ├── android/
    └── pubspec.yaml
```

For now the folder only contains placeholder files so Git tracks the intended structure. Follow `HELLO_WORLD_PLAN.md` when populating it.
