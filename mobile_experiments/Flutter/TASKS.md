# Task Backlog

| ID | Status | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| T1 | ⏳ | Install Flutter SDK + tooling (see `SETUP.md`) and capture any blockers. |
| T2 | ⏳ | Scaffold `app/hello_flutter` via `flutter create` and commit the minimal diff. |
| T3 | ⏳ | Customize `lib/main.dart` to follow `HELLO_WORLD_PLAN.md` (custom theme + text). |
| T4 | ⏳ | Run the app on iOS Simulator and/or Android Emulator; log findings in `DOCUMENTATION.md`. |
