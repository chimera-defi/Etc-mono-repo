# Agent Playbook

## Mission
Spin up a Flutter "Hello World" experience that demonstrates our baseline expectations for a cross-platform experiment: fast iteration, platform parity notes, and parity docs vs. Valdi.

## Success Criteria
- Flutter SDK installed and validated with `flutter doctor`.
- Flutter project structure scaffolded under `app/` (use `flutter create hello_flutter` or `flutter create .`).
- ✅ **Code exists**: `app/lib/main.dart` already implements Hello World with branded copy (matches `HELLO_WORLD_PLAN.md`).
- Existing code integrated into scaffolded project structure.
- Build & run instructions captured for both iOS simulator and Android emulator (or real devices).
- Any blockers, environment issues, or doc discoveries logged in `DOCUMENTATION.md` & `NEXT_STEPS.md`.

## Ways of Working
- Keep generated artifacts (build/, .dart_tool/, etc.) out of version control (see `.gitignore`).
- Prefer documenting assumptions before writing speculative code.
- If you discover better docs than the ones referenced here, append them to `DOCUMENTATION.md` with short summaries.
- Align all plans with `HELLO_WORLD_PLAN.md`; update it if scope changes.
