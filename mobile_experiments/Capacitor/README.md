# Capacitor Experiment

This project explores **Capacitor**, the modern successor to PhoneGap/Cordova, for converting web applications into native mobile apps.

## Overview

Capacitor allows you to:
- Wrap existing web apps (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS) into native iOS/Android apps
- Access native device features (camera, GPS, notifications, etc.) via JavaScript APIs
- Deploy a single codebase to iOS, Android, and Web
- Maintain 100% code reuse from your web application

## Project Status

✅ **All Decisions Made** - Ready for implementation. Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` or `HANDOFF.md` step-by-step.

### ✅ Decisions Made
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **App Name**: CapacitorHelloWorld
- **App ID**: com.example.capacitorhelloworld
- **Plugins**: Camera + Geolocation (code provided)

## Goals

1. **Hello World App**: Create a simple web app and wrap it with Capacitor
2. **Native Features Demo**: Demonstrate access to device features (camera, geolocation, etc.)
3. **Framework Comparison**: Compare Capacitor vs React Native vs Flutter
4. **Documentation**: Document setup process, capabilities, and best practices
