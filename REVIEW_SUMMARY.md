## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Valdi Testing** - Code ready, needs installation/testing
2. **AI Toolkit Prototype** - Start with Outlines or Guardrails

### Medium Priority
3. **Flutter Project** - Create and test hello world
4. **React Native Project** - Create and test hello world

### Low Priority
5. **Cross-Experiment Comparison** - Document developer experience

## For Next Agents

**Start Here**:
1. Read [`PROJECT_REVIEW.md`](./PROJECT_REVIEW.md) - Full assessment
2. Read [`EXPERIMENTS_INDEX.md`](./EXPERIMENTS_INDEX.md) - Navigation guide
3. Choose experiment → Read its `HANDOFF.md`
4. Follow handoff instructions

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ Verify installations before documenting as complete
- ✅ Update `TASKS.md` as work progresses
- ✅ Document learnings in `UNDERSTANDING.md`
- ✅ Update `HANDOFF.md` if process changes
