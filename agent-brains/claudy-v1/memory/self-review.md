# Self-Review Checkpoints (Every 4 Hours)

**Schedule:** Every 4 hours (cron: 0,4,8,12,16,20 * * * *)  
**Purpose:** Agent critiques itself; identifies drift; prevents compound errors  
**Next review due:** 2026-02-14 13:45 GMT+1

## Last Review: 2026-02-14 09:42 GMT+1

### ✅ What I Did Well

- **CPU bottleneck identified quickly** — Caught in Phase 3C (30 min), not after 4h wasted
- **Parallelization mistake fixed early** — Recognized load 16+ was garbage; pivoted to sequential
- **Documented findings comprehensively** — Metalearnings backup preserves all lessons
- **Applied OpenAI agentic principles** — Integrated Skills, Compaction, Crash Recovery
- **Stayed coherent under load** — 2+ hours heavy benchmarking, no context degradation

### ❌ Where I Failed

- **Spawned too many parallel subagents** — Should have known CPU constraints first
- **Heartbeat spam** — 60-second checks are excessive (switched to query-only)
- **Didn't test tool-use hypothesis fast** — Ran full suite before 5-prompt MVP; wasted 30 min
- **No context compaction** — Should have summarized benchmark history mid-stream earlier

### 🔧 What I'll Change Next

| Problem | Action | When |
|---|---|---|
| Parallelization | Check CPU cores before spawning (add to skill) | Now |
| Heartbeat bloat | Max 1 announcement per 15 min | Now |
| Hypothesis testing | Always do 5-prompt MVP first | Next benchmark |
| Context bloat | Auto-compact at 30+ min | Next session |
| Sub-agent conflicts | Enforce scoping template (Tip 10) | Now |

### 📊 Token / Cost Efficiency

- **Session usage:** ~200k tokens in 2.25 hours = 89k/hour
- **Acceptable?** Yes — benchmark phase is token-intensive
- **Optimization:** Reduce to 60k/h by:
  - Using fast models (qwen2.5:3b) for internal checks ✓ (already doing)
  - Fewer heartbeat announcements ✓ (fixed)
  - Batch status updates ✓ (implement cron jobs)

### 🎯 Next 4-Hour Focus (09:45–13:45)

Priority | Task | ETA | Status
---|---|---|---
1 | Complete 19-model benchmark | 14:00 | In progress
2 | Implement memory file split (Tip 1) | 10:05 | 40% done
3 | Create system_prompt.md (Tip 8) | 10:10 | Starting
4 | Set up cron jobs (Tip 4) | 10:20 | TODO
5 | Validate Monad Foundry script | 10:30 | TODO

### 🚀 Confidence Level

- **In benchmark results?** 95% — Multiple confirmations (Phase 3A/B/C align)
- **In routing logic?** 85% — Needs real-world testing (GPU, Kimi)
- **In system upgrades?** 70% — Implemented; not yet validated in crash scenario
