## Server migration actions
- Approved Telegram pairing request `qka5ajr8`.
- Initialized local identity/profile files for this server.
- Configured git author and created initial workspace commit.
- Set up SSH trust from new server to old server (`root@5.78.93.126`).

## Imported from old server (curated)
- Reviewed old memory and extracted only durable preferences/operational lessons.
- Rebuilt `MEMORY.md` in concise distilled form.
- Did not blindly copy old memory logs into long-term memory.

## Dev repo recreation (from upstream only, no project dependency installs)
Cloned into `/root/.openclaw/workspace/dev`:
- `Etc-mono-repo` (ok)
- `napkin` (ok)
- `onecontext` (ok)
- `SharedStake-ui` (ssh clone failed, https fallback succeeded)
- `takopi` (ok)

## Takopi recreation
- Installed `uv` and `takopi` CLI (`takopi 0.22.1`).
- Migrated `.takopi/takopi.toml` from old server and rewrote project paths to this server.
- Migrated Takopi state files (`takopi.lock`, topic/session state).
- Sensitive token remains only in local config file; not echoed into chat logs.
