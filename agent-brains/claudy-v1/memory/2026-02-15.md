## Major Refactoring: OpenAI Harness Engineering Principles

### What Was Read
- OpenAI article: "Harness engineering: leveraging Codex in an agent-first world"
- Key insight: Agent systems succeed through disciplined **scaffolding**, not code

### What Was Done

**1. Created `docs/` as system of record:**
- `docs/README.md` — Navigation hub
- `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` — Golden rules (6 core + 3 domain-specific)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System design, layering, interfaces
- `docs/DOMAIN.md` — Eth2/staking knowledge (schemas, parameters, risks)
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` — Deployment, monitoring, scaling, recovery
- `docs/MEMORY_MAP.md` — How memory is organized + maintained

**2. Refactored AGENTS.md:**
- Was 8.8 KB of scattered guidance
- Now 100 lines: Just a table of contents
- All actual content moved to `docs/`
- Principle: Progressive disclosure (start with map, learn details)

**3. Updated MEMORY.md:**
- Added durable decisions (git practice, documentation, arch)
- Decision log (what + why)
- Known lessons (what works / what doesn't)
- Maintenance rhythm (heartbeat, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)

**4. Built enforcement mechanisms:**
- `linters/doc_freshness.sh` — Fails if docs >30 days old
- `scripts/verify_setup.sh` — Pre-flight checks for agent system

**5. Committed to git:**
- Feature branch: `ideas/autonomous-social-agent`
- Commit: "chore: internalize OpenAI harness engineering principles"

### Why This Matters

From the article:
> "Building software with agents demands discipline in scaffolding, not code."

**Before:**
- Scattered context (SOUL.md, USER.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md)
- Large instruction files that rot
- No mechanical verification
- Agents had to guess what's current

**After:**
- Single source of truth: `docs/` in git
- Short, stable entry point: `AGENTS.md`
- Mechanical enforcement: linters + CI
- Agents know exactly where to look

### Projects Status

**eth2-quickstart:**
- ✅ 515/515 tests passed locally (lint + unit)
- 🔄 Docker-compose tests running now (Phase 1)
- ⏳ Remote deployment pending (Phase 2, after Phase 1 passes)

### Next Steps

1. ⏳ Wait for docker-compose test results (subagent working)
2. If Phase 1 passes → deploy to eth2-claw (Phase 2)
3. Implement doc-gardening cron job (background cleanup)
4. Add CI linter integration (fail PRs if docs stale)

### Blockers
None. System is ready.

## Side Notes
- Used `memory_search` - encountered OpenAI quota issue (expected)
- Verified system setup passes all checks ✅
- Currently on feature branch `ideas/autonomous-social-agent` (good practice)
