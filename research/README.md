This folder is for “random things” we want to quickly research and capture as lightweight notes.

### How to add a new topic

1. Create a new file named like `YYYY-MM-DD__topic-slug.md`.
2. Keep it short and practical:
   - **Question**
   - **Answer (tl;dr)**
   - **Recommended approach (if applicable)**
   - **Notes / Caveats**
   - **Links (optional)**
