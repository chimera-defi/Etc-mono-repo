# 2026-02-12

- User preference: do not create PRs against takopi (not owned / out of scope unless explicitly requested).
- Scope preference for dependency/cleanup work: include `SharedStake-ui` alongside owned repos.
- Compaction workflow preference: write handoff file before context reset and resume from handoff in a fresh thread.
- Meta-learning preference: always save durable meta learnings to stable local memory; periodically review memory for clarity, concision, and cleanup.
- Memory search currently degraded due to OpenAI embedding quota (`insufficient_quota`); local embedding provider exploration is requested.
- Retrieval strategy preference: use QMD BM25 for fast targeted retrieval, paired with local embeddings for semantic memory recall.
- Dependency/disk strategy preference: avoid full monorepo installs; install only as needed and favor disk-efficient package manager choices (pnpm dedupe benefits, bun for speed where appropriate).
- Research/tooling blocker: web_search currently unavailable without Brave API key; local docs-first workflow remains default.
- Agent-rules meta-learning: keep instruction files lean and non-duplicative; use a single source of truth plus pointers to detailed docs to reduce context/token overhead.
- In Etc-mono-repo, `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` were refactored to remove repetitive benchmark/rule duplication while preserving critical operational and CI requirements.
