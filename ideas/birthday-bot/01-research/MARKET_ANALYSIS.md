## Market Challenges & Risks

### 1. Market Saturation
- **Risk**: Many free alternatives exist
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on UX/design quality (Figma, Dribbble standards)
  - Build network effects (sharing, groups, coordinated gifting)
  - Premium features for monetization

### 2. Network Effects Problem
- **Risk**: App is only valuable if you have friends using it
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with solo features (import, reminders, search)
  - Optional: Build optional sharing/group features later
  - Don't require network to be useful (unlike Snapchat)

### 3. Low User Retention
- **Risk**: People use once, then forget about it
- **Mitigation**:
  - Push notifications keep app top-of-mind
  - Recurring monthly use pattern (birthdays every month)
  - Engagement features: streaks, stats, milestones

### 4. Social Media API Restrictions
- **Risk**: Facebook/Instagram APIs keep getting more restrictive
- **Mitigation**:
  - Don't depend on social media integrations
  - Build on stable APIs (Google, Apple native)
  - Offer browser extension for advanced users

### 5. Monetization Challenges
- **Risk**: Users expect free birthday apps
- **Mitigation**:
  - Offer core features free (contact import, reminders)
  - Premium: SMS notifications, gift tracking, greeting cards
  - B2B: Team/workplace birthdays (paid tier for HR teams)
