## Idea Validation Bot (Voice → Interview → Adversarial Validation → PRD)

**Status**: Exploration (docs-first)

### Concept
A mobile “idea bot” that:
- Records your voice and transcribes it (voice → text)
- Runs a structured, multi-stage interview to clarify and pressure-test your idea
- Performs feasibility + adversarial validation (business model, GTM, constraints)
- Produces an **agent-ready PRD/spec** that coding agents can implement

### Why this might matter
Most “idea validation” outputs are generic. The wedge here is **structured extraction + adversarial testing + actionable artifacts** (PRD + technical spec + experiment plan) that meaningfully reduce time-to-build.

### Docs
- `PRD.md`: product requirements and MVP definition
- `SPEC.md`: technical design for an initial build
- `QUESTION_FLOW.md`: interview script + state machine (what the bot asks and why)
- `ADVERSARIAL_TESTS.md`: red-team tests and kill criteria
- `FEASIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md`: feasibility + cost/complexity notes
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`: agent-ready implementation handoff
- `RESEARCH_PROMPT.md`: focused research prompts for next iteration
