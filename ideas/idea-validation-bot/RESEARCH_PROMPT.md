## Research Prompt (Next Iteration)

Use this prompt to do a focused research pass and update the PRD/SPEC with citations.

### What to research
- Existing “PRD generator” and “idea validation” products (including within broader PM tooling)
- Voice-first founder tools (dictation + structured output)
- Typical willingness-to-pay for founder/PM productivity tools
- STT provider tradeoffs (cost, latency, accuracy, mobile integration)
- Legal/safety considerations for “business advice” positioning

### Output format
- Competitor table (name, positioning, pricing, strengths, weaknesses, what’s missing)
- Clear wedge recommendation for this product
- 3–5 GTM channels to test first (with rationale)
- Updated pricing hypothesis and gross margin assumptions

### Suggested prompt to run elsewhere
> You are a research assistant. Find existing products that generate PRDs/specs or validate startup ideas, including AI-powered PM tools. For each, summarize their key features, pricing (if public), and positioning. Then propose a differentiation strategy for a voice-first “Idea Validation Bot” that outputs an agent-ready PRD/spec, and recommend a minimal MVP wedge plus first GTM channel. Cite sources.
