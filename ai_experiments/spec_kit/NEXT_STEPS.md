# Next Steps — Spec Kit

1. Install the CLI in a throwaway Node environment and confirm `speckit build` works with the sample specs.
2. Author a minimal spec for a toy "travel approval" workflow so we can see how strict enumerations behave.
3. Wire the generated validator into a lightweight API route and capture telemetry on passes vs. failures.
4. Decide whether compiled spec artifacts live inside this repo or in a separate package for sharing across services.
