# Next Steps — B-MAD Method

1. Install B-MAD Method v6 alpha and run `*workflow-init` on a sample project to understand the analysis phase.
2. Test Quick Flow track with a simple bug fix to evaluate workflow efficiency vs. ad-hoc AI assistance.
3. Test B-MAD Method track with a product feature to see how specialized agents (PM, Architect, Developer) collaborate.
4. Explore B-MAD Builder to determine if custom workflows can enforce constraint policies similar to other tools.
5. Compare B-MAD's planning outputs with Spec Kit specs to understand complementary vs. competing approaches.
6. Assess whether B-MAD Method addresses constraint validation needs or if it should be paired with runtime validators.
