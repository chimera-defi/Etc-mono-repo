# Handoff — B-MAD Method Track

- **Bootstrap:** `npx bmad-method@alpha install` (v6) or `npx bmad-method install` (v4 stable). Requires Node.js 20+.
- **Artifacts:** B-MAD workflows generate planning documents, architecture specs, and implementation guides. These live alongside project code.
- **Deliverable:** Evaluate B-MAD Method as a development methodology framework and determine if it complements or competes with constraint validation tools.
- **Watchouts:** B-MAD is a methodology/workflow tool, not a runtime validator. It structures development processes rather than validating LLM outputs. Consider whether it addresses our constraint needs or should be paired with tools like Guardrails/Outlines.
- **Exit Criteria:** Clear understanding of B-MAD's role in our toolkit—whether it's complementary to constraint tools or serves a different purpose entirely. Document integration possibilities if applicable.
