# B-MAD Method (`bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD`)

## Overview
B-MAD (Build More, Architect Dreams) is a comprehensive AI-driven agile development methodology built on top of the B-MAD Core framework. Unlike pure constraint/validation tools, B-MAD provides a complete development lifecycle framework with specialized AI agents, workflows, and scale-adaptive planning. It focuses on structured workflows powered by 19 specialized agents (PM, Architect, Developer, UX Designer, etc.) working together across 4 phases: Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, and Implementation.

## Constraint Mechanisms
- **Structured workflows:** 50+ guided workflows that adapt from bug fixes to enterprise systems
- **Specialized agents:** 19 domain-specific agents with deep expertise (Product, Architecture, Testing, UX, etc.)
- **Scale-adaptive intelligence:** Automatically adjusts planning depth based on project complexity
- **Workflow enforcement:** Built-in methodology ensures consistent development practices
- **Document sharding:** 90% token savings for large projects through intelligent document management

## Integration Sketch
1. Install via npm: `npx bmad-method@alpha install` (v6 alpha) or `npx bmad-method install` (v4 stable)
2. Initialize project: Load any agent in your IDE and run `*workflow-init` to analyze your project
3. Choose track: Quick Flow (bug fixes), B-MAD Method (products/platforms), or Enterprise (compliance/scale)
4. Execute workflows: Agents guide you through Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation phases
5. Customize: Use B-MAD Builder to create custom agents and workflows for domain-specific needs

## Considerations
- Primarily a development methodology/workflow framework rather than a runtime constraint validator
- JavaScript/TypeScript-first with Node.js 20+ requirement; Python support is limited
- Works best with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurfer, VS Code IDEs
- v6 is in alpha status; v4 is production-ready but less feature-rich
- Focuses on development process constraints rather than LLM output validation
