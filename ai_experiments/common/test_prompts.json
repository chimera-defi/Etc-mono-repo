My grandfather always told me stories about his time in Italy during the 1960s when he worked as a chef in a small restaurant in Tuscany. He met my grandmother there - she was a local from Florence studying art history. They fell in love over plates of fresh pasta and bottles of Chianti. Eventually they moved to America but always talked about going back. Now I want to retrace their journey with my family - my wife Sarah, our three kids Tommy (12), Lisa (9), and baby Marco (2), and hopefully bring along my 85-year-old grandmother who hasn't been back since 1965. We have about $15,000 saved and can take 3 weeks off in June. I want to visit Florence, the Tuscan countryside especially the town of Montepulciano where the restaurant was, Rome, and maybe the Amalfi Coast. We need kid-friendly activities but also want some romantic moments for me and Sarah, and obviously wheelchair accessibility for grandma. Also my son is vegetarian and my daughter is allergic to nuts. Can you help plan this dream trip?",
