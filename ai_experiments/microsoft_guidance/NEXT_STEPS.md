# Next Steps — Microsoft Guidance

1. Spin up a notebook or script that runs the stock Guidance examples to validate the environment.
2. Translate one of our existing prompts into a Guidance template and compare determinism vs. baseline.
3. Add automated tests that execute the template against a mock model to catch syntax regressions.
4. Decide whether to keep templates inline (Python files) or externalize into `.guidance` files for easier editing.
