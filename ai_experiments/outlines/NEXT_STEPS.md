# Next Steps — Outlines

1. Follow the README quickstart to ensure grammar-constrained decoding works in our environment.
2. Model our first schema (probably the same workflow used in other toolkits) to keep comparisons apples-to-apples.
3. Instrument timing + token stats so we can quantify decoding overhead.
4. Decide whether to host Outlines inside the main API or a dedicated structured-generation microservice.
