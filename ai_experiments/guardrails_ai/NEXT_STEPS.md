# Next Steps — Guardrails AI

1. Recreate the "QA bot" example from the docs to make sure `.rail` parsing works in our environment.
2. Draft domain-specific validators (e.g., ensure responses cite at least one approved knowledge source).
3. Decide on deployment pattern: embed guardrails inside the main API vs. run as a sidecar microservice.
4. Capture success/failure metrics to compare Guardrails vs. Spec Kit for the same workflow.
