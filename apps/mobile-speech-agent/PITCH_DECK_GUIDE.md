## Slide-by-Slide Breakdown

### Slide 1: Cover

**Visual:** App logo + tagline
**Text:**
```
[Company Name]
The First Mobile AI Coding Assistant with Voice

[Your Name], Founder
[Contact Info]
[Date]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Clean, professional design
- Use brand colors (suggest: tech blue/purple gradient)
- Include app screenshot or mockup

---

### Slide 2: The Problem

**Hook:** "Developers want to code everywhere, but are stuck at their desks"

**3 Key Pain Points:**

1. **Desktop Lock-in**
   - "Current AI coding tools (Cursor $29B, Claude Code $600M revenue) are desktop-only"
   - Visual: Developer chained to desk with laptop

2. **Slow Typing**
   - "Developers type at 40 WPM but can speak at 150 WPM"
   - Visual: Comparison chart (voice 3.75x faster)

3. **No Mobile-First Solution**
   - "73% of companies hire remote developers, but no mobile coding tool exists"
   - Visual: Remote workers on phones/tablets

**Data to Include:**
- 28.7M global developers
- 73% of companies hiring remote (2025)
- $23.97B AI developer tools market by 2030

---

### Slide 3: The Solution

**Tagline:** "Code with your voice, anywhere"

**Core Features:**

**Key Message:** "The ONLY mobile + voice + AI coding solution"

---

### Slide 4: Product Demo

**Visual:** 4-panel screenshot flow

```
Panel 1: Voice Recording
"Start an agent on my wallet-frontend repo..."

"Analyzing codebase... Creating files..."

Panel 3: Real-time Progress
"✓ Created LoginPage.tsx
 ⋯ Adding validation..."

Panel 4: Completion
"Agent completed!
 3 files changed, +127 lines"
```

**Alt: Video Demo (30 seconds)**
- Record actual app usage
- Show voice → agent → code flow
- Highlight speed (complete task in <1 minute)

### Slide 12: Why Now?

**Market Timing:**

1. **AI Coding Boom**
   - Cursor $29.3B (2025), $1B revenue in 12 months
   - "Vibe coding" = Word of the Year 2025
   - 57% of developers now use AI coding tools

2. **Voice Tech Maturity**
   - Whisper API: 95-98% accuracy (2025)
   - Technical vocabulary recognition solved
   - $0.006/min cost (affordable)

3. **Remote Work Shift**
   - 73% of companies hiring remote developers
   - Mobile-first becoming standard
   - Developers want portability

4. **Competitor Weakness**
   - Cursor pricing backlash (Sept 2025)
   - Claude Code usage limit crisis (Sept 2025)
   - User dissatisfaction at all-time high

**Window of Opportunity:** 12-18 months before big players add mobile

**Key Message:** "Perfect storm - technology ready, market ready, competition weak"

### Slide 13: Risks & Mitigation

**Be Transparent About Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Cost explosion** | High | Critical | Strict usage limits, $15 pricing |
| **Cursor adds mobile** | Medium | High | Move fast, 12-month head start |
| **Voice stays niche** | Medium | High | Offer text input as fallback |
| **Technical complexity** | Medium | Medium | Reduced MVP scope, phased rollout |
| **Small TAM** | High | Medium | Bootstrap, not VC-scale |

**De-Risk Strategy:**
1. **Decision gates** - Kill if metrics not met (Week 4, 8, 16)
2. **Lean approach** - $20K budget, solo founder start
3. **Fast iteration** - 4-week alpha, learn quickly
4. **Pivot options** - Enterprise focus, desktop version, licensing

**Key Message:** "We know the risks, we have mitigation plans"
